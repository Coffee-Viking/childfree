**Alexander City** 

[William H. Moore, MD](https://russellcares.com/physicians/william-h-moore-md/),  I’ve been seeing him for over a year and love how he treats me as a patient. He’s gentle, quick, and transparent. I asked him for a bisalp a month ago and didn’t need to say any more than “I would like sterilization”. He understood and, without discouraging me, made sure I knew of the alternatives: birth control, implants, iuds, etc. I reaffirmed my desire for surgery, specifically a bisalp, and he agreed. He helped me get started with paperwork and preparation for said surgery and again covered the basics about surgical risks and assured me I’d be in good hands. After a waiting period of 30 days (and a pre-op visit with him to again go over what to expect and how to prepare) I went into the hospital and was out after a few hours. Dr. Moore visited me before the surgery but I was asleep (took an anxiety med) so my mother spoke to him instead. The surgery went well, and I only received two incisions that he sealed with glue. They gave me post-op instructions and sent me home once I was able to leave.

[Dr. Sarah Aultman, Brookwood Women's Care](http://brookwoodprimarycare.com/dr-sarah-aultman.php) (IUDs, Tubal, long-term birth control for young women) 

[Dr. Margaret Miklic, Women's Health Specialists of Grandview](https://www.grandviewmedicalgroup.com/doctors-providers/miklic-margaret-md-6302) (Bilateral Salpingectomy; she said she could tell I'd done my research because I asked specifically for a Bilateral Salpingectomy, and completely understood that people have different life choices. Gave me zero issues, just said "When would you like to schedule this?" She had previously done my mom's hysterectomy, and she is 100% willing to work with you to find a birth control that works for you and with your insurance. She is very chill and easygoing, and has the best professional bedside manner I have ever encountered.)

+1 Dr Miklic - bisalp on 23F August 2022. Dr. was respectful and took patient seriously.

[Dr. Kristen Vaughan](https://www.grandviewhealth.com/find-a-doctor/vaughan-kristen-md-27638). She performed my bilateral salpingectomy. She was very receptive to my desire for the surgery and didn't make me jump through any hoops, although I was pro-active and brought a letter from my psychologist saying I was of sound mind to make that decision.

+1 Dr Vaughn, Bilateral Salpingectomy. (She also offered a tubal but was receptive when I said the risk of tubal pregnancy was too much for me.) I am 29 years old. Cis. Single. And have 0 children. I have been told no many times since I turned 19 for this procedure until I saw Dr. Vaughan. No judgement for my decision, just went over her legal duties to inform me of the base statistics but approved me on my first visit. Did not need a partner signature, was never told I'd change my mind, it was a deep conversation with no pushing from her. Within 3 weeks I had surgery and the entire experience was better than I could have imagined! She also kept in my uterine implant because "who wants a menstrual cycle" when I asked to keep it in!

[Dr Elizabeth Barron](https://wcspc.com/). She is at Grandview in Birmingham, AL at womens care specialists. I am 32, single, and childfree and she performed a bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation for me last Friday. She was willing to do it when I originally asked 5 yrs ago as well but I didn't want to risk surgery with drug allergies.

[Dr. Virginia Winston](https://www.grandviewmedicalgroup.com/doctors-providers/winston-virginia-md-6306?utm_campaign=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=local). She did my tubal ligation when I was 27, single, 0 children. On my very first visit with her, I half jokingly said "instead of an IUD, I'd rather just get a tubal." She said "well, we can do that!" 3 weeks later, with no interrogation or questioning, she did my tubal. While I was in pre-op, she excitedly came through the door and cheerily sang "who's ready to say bye bye to their fertility!?" Highly recommended.

I was able to bring up a bilateral salpingectomy on my first appointment and get approved at the same appointment. I didn't even need the binder, but I was married and 25 at the time of asking.

+1 Dr. Marker: 27 year old married self-pay patient for bisalp. Costs as of July 2022:First appointment $150 on site+ $94 bloodwork billed by lab; Pre op appointment day before surgery $600 paid on site;Surgery cost at Flowers $5663; Anesthesia: not yet billed.

[Dr. Jeanine M. Loncar](https://www.clinicforwomen.com/index.cfm?pagepath=Our_Doctors/Dr__Jeanine_M__Loncar&amp;amp;id=37589 ) (Bilateral Salpingectomy, IUD)

[Dr. Paul Zbell](https://www.northalaurology.com/), North Alabama Urology PC. 825 Adams St SE Huntsville, AL 35801 Phone: (256) 536-9020 AND 9238 Madison Blvd. Suite 114 Madison, AL 35758. Husband went in for a consultation and then scheduled his procedure during the consultation. This office has two locations - Madison & Huntsville, Alabama. Husband got in for a Friday appointment and was back at work the following Tuesday after a 3 day holiday weekend. Had a follow up appointment a week later to make sure all is well. Told to provide a sperm sample in 3 months for analysis to ensure everything has gone according to plan. Dr. Zbell is courteous and easy to relate to. There are also other urologists at this practice that offer the same procedure. Before insurance, the billed cost was about $450. In our case, insurance covered the bill.

+1 Dr. Zbell. Recommended by 23-year-old redditor for vasectomy.

[Dr. Anne Marie Reidy, MD, JD](https://www.women4womenhsv.com/) Bilateral salpingectomy 34 (could have done it sooner), married (she would have done even if I wasn't married), no kids. Procedure was March 9th, 2021. Her office wait times are minimal compared to my old doctor. Iwas prepared to fight for what I wanted. I told the nurse practioner what I wanted and she said we should be able to do that. There was no fuss from my insurance company. We have Local Government Health Insurance Plan (LGHIP). Nothing out of pocket. Best part, no one bingo'd me. More information: She has been my OBGYN for about 14 years. Great doctor! I've been recommending her to anyone who ask who do I use. She's also performed the operation on one of my friends. She would have been 32 at the time.

Dr Callison at TN VALLEY OBGYN in HSV AL. Got bisalp scheduled day of first new patient consultation with her. I am 23 and do not have any kids. She was super nice, understanding, and not judgey at all!

+1 Dr Callison at Tennessee Valley OBGYN (Crestwood location) in Huntsville, AL. She is very progressive, empathetic, and reasonable. I haven't seen all the doctors at TNVOBGYN, but I get the impression that the office is very united in their stance on bodily autonomy. I'm 25 (almost 26) and asked for a hysterectomy specifically. She treated me like an adult capable of making permanent decisions about my own body, and she said it's ridiculous that some doctors make women jump through every possible hoop (patch, pill, ring, IUD, etc.) before considering sterilization. She had very sound reasoning for the medical benefits of the procedure, and she was very quick and reassuring during the exam. I'm scheduled for a pre-OP ultrasound, and she told me I could pick any upcoming O.R. availability and we could get it done ASAP! For hysterectomies, she likes to also take out the cervix and tubes for cancer prevention but leave the ovaries in to prevent early menopause. ("Take out the bad stuff, leave the good stuff in!")

[Victoria Perkins, MD](https://www.tvobgyn.com/victoria-perkins-md). This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise she provides: laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, Hysterectomy. 

Dr. Krishna Kakani in Huntsville, AL - bilateral salpingectomy. She was very nice and understanding. She didn't ask many questions and my procedure was done exactly seven days later. I was 32 years old at the time.

-1 Dr Kakani, do NOT consult with this doctor if under 30. 

[Dr. Jeanine M. Loncar](https://www.clinicforwomen.com/index.cfm?pagepath=Our_Doctors/Dr__Jeanine_M__Loncar&amp;amp;id=37589 ) (Bilateral Salpingectomy, IUD)

**Madison**

[Dr. Rachel Acuff](https://obgynalabama.com/dr-rachel-acuff/) at OBGYN Associates. She did a bilateral salpingectomy on me. I am 24, single, no kids. The doctor was very friendly, didn’t try to persuade me out of the decision. Cost about $730 after insurance. Waited about a month and a half between initial consultation and the surgery.

[Dr. Hope McLean](https://www.azaleacityphysicians.com/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am 25, single, and have had zero children. I went in not expecting to be approved, but Dr McLean was very respectful, made sure I had thought about all options and made it clear she respected my decision and scheduled me a month after the first appt. She informed me of every step of the procedure and had great bedside manner. The procedure itself was a breeze and I am on day 2 of recovery and have had little to no side effects! With insurance, the procedure was $516.08.

[Dr. Katelyn Parnell — Mobile, Alabama](https://www.coastalobgyn.com/). IUD and bisalp. Six years with an IUD under her care, and just today received my bilateral salpingectomy from her. I am 31 cis F, married to a man, and no children. I originally told her I wanted the bisalp in April and she was in the middle of changing practices, and as soon as I called her new one on their opening day I had my surgery scheduled before the month was out. She made sure I understood all risks and other options but was not condescending (though there was a “we always advise women in your age group esp with no children there’s a high chance of regret,” but ended it with “I respect your autonomy” and gave no pushback). Also did NOT require permission from my husband.

**Montgomery**

[Dr. Jehle](http://www.montgomerywomenshealth.com/montgomery-gynecologist-jehle.php) in July 2022. I was approved during my initial consultation after she asked a few questions and determined that I was certain of my decision and understood the permanence of the procedure.

Feb. 2023. Bisalp on 25-year-old redditor. Consultation 01-23-23. Needed second pap, done w/ultrasound on 02-01-23. Surgery on 02-23-23. Zero Bingos! During initial consult Dr. Dockery went over everything factually and I ended up telling him I knew it was irreversible etc. and he got started on the next step with no fuss. Medical history was asked on a phone call prior and some asked again in preop. Dockery uses stitches that need to be taken out ten days after. 100/10 would do again.

**Tuscaloosa**

[Dr. Mentel from Partlow, Harbin, & Poist OB/GYN](https://www.partlowharbinandpoist.com/) Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Bi-salp with Ablation. 26f, single, devoutly CF. Dr and team were absolutely wonderful. I went in thinking I'd have to fight an uphill battle for my cause. Dr took one cursory glance at my binder and said "I'm not going to punish you for knowing what you want. Let me get my booking calendar." I got my surgery less than a month later

[Dr Sid Smith]( https://www.dchsystem.com/find-a-doctor/james-sidney-smith-md/) I had a bilateral salpingectomy at age 26, single, no children. It was a 3 visit process: 1st to request the procedure and discuss that I was serious, 2nd to do the pre-op tests, 3rd was the surgery. It cost me $800 with Blue Cross (all deductible). He was very respectful throughout. I did not get bingoed at all besides the standard Dr questions like are you aware this is permanent, there are less invasive options, etc.

Dr. Matthew Thom is a urologist in Tuscaloosa, AL. My boyfriend and his coworker both used him and weren’t grilled about their choices in the slightest. He was super nice and non-judgmental. Surgery was scheduled and performed quickly with zero complications.

[Dr. Tonya Caylor](http://www.hillsidemedicine.com/) Hillside Family Medicine

She is a GP, does pelvics/paps/STD testing, and also inserted my Nexplanon. I believe she can also insert IUDs in-house. I just saw her for an initial consult about sterilization, and she warned me of the potential difficulties of getting it done as a woman under 30, but referred me to the local gyns she thought would be most likely to want to help me get it done now and is rooting for me. Very CF friendly, kind, and non-judgemental. I am 26/F.

Will be preforming my bilateral salpingectomy and also inserting an IUD. Didn’t give me any trouble approving me for my sterilization. Does all the general woman’s health stuff too. 3260 Providence Drive Suite 322,  (Providence Alaska Medical Center, Bldg. C)

[Dr. Alyson Gibbs](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-allison-gibbs-yrlg7), Anchorage Women's Clinic in Anchorage, address: Providence C Tower, 3260 Providence Dr #425, Anchorage, AK 99508. I had a consultation on 10/18, I was asked about other less permanent birth control I had tried, and counseled about regret. She did her due diligence to make sure I was sure but did not push back and accepted my answers at face value. I am 30 next month and married for nearly 5 years, for what its worth. I had my bi-salp on 12/9/2021. I did not need a referral for this procedure and medicaid paid for everything in full, except for a $9 prescription for painkillers.

###ARIZONA

**Chandler**

[Dr Reyes-Hailey](http://www.newhorizonswomenscare.com/home/phys-docs-celinareyeshailey.php), did my Essure about 10 years ago with no pushback. Went back today for ablation and in our conversation Dr Reyes-Hailey stated, "your body and fertility are your choice to make". 39NB (AFAB)

+1 Dr Reyes-Hailey, who is now (May 2022) booked out until September (2022), I just saw Dr. Reyes-Hailey, who I found via this list. (She didn’t even ask if I was sure, she just said she’ll do the tubal for me! The ball is rolling!). She has been overwhelmed with the number of new patients coming in. She explicitly told me that all doctors under New Horizons, at least in their clinic in Chandler, are happy to perform tubal ligations, just as much so as herself. She would be relieved to have patients go to any of the other doctors under New Horizons Chandler.

+1 Dr. Reyes-Hailey. Bisalp on 26yo redditor. She said anyone over the age of 21 (I think) she will perform a bilateral salpingectomy upon request. Anyone under 21 she has them wait for a short amount of time and will still do it if they are still resolved to get the procedure by the end of the waiting period.

Dr. Ernestine Bustamante at New Horizons Women's Health in Chandler, Arizona. She was very nice and non judgmental. Laparoscopic salpingectomy 26F.

Dr. Judith Adams, bilateral salpingectomy. Age:29 Marital status: married No kids at all. Dr Adams did not bingo me nor did she ask for permission from my husband. She was very supportive of allowing patients to make decisions about their bodies. She also alluded to the need to women to make appropriate choices for themselves given current events. She was a pleasure to work with. NB do not seek care with this doctor if aged under 25 - she refused sterilisation for a 22 year old. 

Dr. Andrew Villa Jr., MD, You can put that he is full pro-choice and very supportive. Didnt bingo me once and was even annoyed at the idea that anyone would have a hard time getting a procedure done because it's their body!

[Dr. Whitney Ramos-Jensen](https://valleywomenforwomen.com/?ae_global_templates=physician-whitney-ramos-jensen) at Valley Women for Women in Chandler, AZ did my bisalp. I am 42F, widowed, with no kids. She answered all of my questions, was impressed by the research I had done, and was fully supportive. OP feels this doctor may be open to sterilising younger people as she is very pro bodily autonomy, but people under 30 should still use caution. 

[Dr. Kathryn Conners](https://healow.com/apps/provider/kathryn-connors-1557496)   655 S Dobson Rd #101, Chandler, AZ 85224, 480-459-2555. Also in Gilbert, AZ. Jan 2023. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor. She and everyone in the hospital were wonderful from start to finish. No bingos just general questions to ensure I really wanted this at the consult. Consult in one appointment October 2022 and then scheduled surgery for January 2023. No bingos at the hospital just everyone making sure I knew what procedure I was having done as is standard for surgery. My insurance with Cigna covered it completely although I did have an issue before surgery with hospital registration, they were trying to charge me an amount up front. I was told by my surgery scheduler to ensure it was being billed as sterilization and to verify the procedure and billing code as Z30.2. Once I relayed this they called my insurance and confirmed it was completely covered and I didn't have to pay up front. 

**Flagstaff** 

[Dr. Phillip Williams, MD, FACOG Flagstaff, Arizona](https://flagstaffobgyn.com/) 24F, single, child free, Laproscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy At my first preop Dr. Williams made sure I knew the procedure was permanent and I told him that was the goal. Every time after that he would say "this is a permanent procedure which I know is what you want but I'm still required to tell you"

[Lindy Vanlandingham](https://northcountryhealthcare.org/providers/lindy-vanlandingham/) at North Country Healthcare (2920 N Fourth St, Flagstaff, Arizona 86004, 928-522-9400). Surgery performed: bilateral salpingectomy. 24F, unmarried, childfree. Scheduled me less than a month after my consultation. Made sure I understood the procedure and said that as long as I understand some people regret the decision and still want to continue, we will do it. Was very comforting day of surgery, and gave me before and after pictures.

[Dr. Diana D. Heard-Vaughn, MD] (http://www.glendaleobgyn.com/about.html) bilateral Tubal Ligation at 24

+1 Dr Heard-Vaughn, Performed bilateral salpingectomy on single childfree 20F with no bingos whatsoever! During my initial appointment she told me that “some people were meant to have nineteen kids and some were meant to have zero”. Seriously can’t recommend her enough!

+1 Dr. Diana Heard in Arizona sterilized me at 19 with a tubal, no bingos. She was amazing and told me that I have full control over my body and she trusts my decisions for myself. She approved me within 3 minutes of seeing her and did the surgery 3 weeks after my consult.

+1 Dr. Heard performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me, single 24F, no questions asked. I enquired about the procedure at my wellness check, got a surgical consult within a week, and was able to schedule the procedure within two weeks. She said, "You don't want kids?" "No." "Alright then let's fix that." She was wonderful!

[Dr. Roscoe S. Nelson MD](https://www.peedoc.com/), 6320 W. Union Hills Dr, B-2600 Glendale, AZ 85308 +1-602-942-5600. Dr. Nelson just sterilized my husband aged 28 with no bingo's and no questions asked. Consultation and procedure were the same day back to back. We couldn't be happier with the experience! Also has a video on his site with FAQ about vasectomies.

[Dr. Zhang](https://desertwestobgyn.com/providers/qi-zhang-md-facog). She is located in Glendale and Phoenix, Arizona. It was only a month between my consult appointment and my procedure. Office was great as well! Tubal ligation.

[Dr Stephen Larsen](https://www.arizona-urology.com/provider/stephen-larsen-md) was phenomenal. Had a consult where he asked my husband if he was sure and explained that it was harder to reverse. Appointment was scheduled a month later- we ended up having to push it out ourselves because of our schedule. But the process was so easy and the office was really nice! This was February of 2021. 

**Kingman**

[Dr. Yusria R. Malik, MD](https://www.azkrmc.com/doctors/yusria-r-malik-md) Kingman OB/GYN Associates, 1739 E Beverly Ave, Ste 200, Kingman, AZ 86409-3593, (928) 681-8705.  Nov 2022. Bisalp on 32-year-old CF redditor. I brought up sterilization at the end of August and she didn’t bingo me; not even once, I signed consent forms in the same visit. She is the most caring doctor I have ever had and women in my area are so lucky to have her here. 

**Maricopa** 

[Dr. Deborah Rowan working at MomDoc](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-deborah-rowan-xkffw) - Tubal ligation ( full removal). I was 32, Single, Never Married and Child Free. Insurance covered a majority of the procedure for me and the cost for the surgeon ( her) was under $1000 for me out of pocket. She was an active listener and did not make me jump through a million hoops. She listened and takes your word and was very good at being detailed and thorough on reasons and options.

**Mesa**

Dr Tony Canestraro, "I am in private practice in Tempe/Mesa, Arizona. I perform sterilization procedures (typically recommend salpingectomy) and gender-affirming surgeries, while allowed by AZ law. I believe strongly in informed consent and patient autonomy and do not have any restrictions for sterilization such as age or parity." Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care, 480-820-6657.

[Dr. Grossklaus](http://www.swurologic.com/) (Vasectomy) Got a vasectomy at 19! He seemed a little apprehensive, but he trusted me when I said I was absolutely sure.

+1 Dr Grossklaus, I was 24M and single when I got it, and outside of the cursory "you do realize this is permanent" and my reasons for being CF was happy to perform the snip. The decor in his exam room was bizarre (incl. a poster detailing "10 ways your gun is better than your wife") and I definitely know he leans right-wing, but not to the extent he was open about it during the procedure.

[Dr. Alice Cooper](http://www.awpgynmesa.com/) A Woman's Place 215 S Power Rd #218 (Tubal Ligation, Bilateral Salpingectomy, need proof and internal exam for endometrial/uterine ablation). Some apprehensiveness and dissuading (probably for liability or peace of mind), but as long as you are sure of yourself and what you want they trust you.

[Dr. Boleslaw Bendek](https://www.adelantehealthcare.com/providers/boleslaw-bendek-md/) in Mesa, Arizona. 35 Female. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Married, no children. No bingos whatsoever. When I thanked him for being so kind and supportive of my choice he said, "No need to thank me. You're the boss." 😭 Took two months from consult to surgery. My insurance covered it 100% bc it falls under family planning.

[Dr. Eugene Adel](https://adelantehealthcare.com/providers/eugene-adel-md/) is incredible. I have gone to 3 providers to try and get accepted for sterilization at my age of 22. Not only that, I was having period problems and he is a great listener and problem solver! He had me sign the consent form today on my first day of meeting me. He asked if i was sure i said yes and said ok i would be happy to perform the surgery. now im just waiting for my surgery i am so freaking excited!

I’m a 23F and I just had a bilateral salpingectomy done by dr Sarah Sharer.
I came in to an appointment to have some information about the procedure and we scheduled the surgery that same day. It all went smoothly, they only had me schedule 30days after that appointment per hospital rules. I have Cigna Health insurance and it was 100% covered by them. I asked Dr Sharer about her opinion on me being a 23y/o with no children coming to do said procedure and she said and I quote “It is your choice. The minimum age in the US for this procedure is 21. If you’re above that, it is completely your choice” which made me feel incredible. She was an angel throughout the whole process.

Dr. Heather Zechman with AZ Gynecology Consultants in Phoenix, AZ, did a bilateral salpingectomy on 25yo childfree me with zero bingoes. Not judgmental at all. And the surgery went great, with very little pain and nausea (credit to both her and the excellent anesthesiologist).

For reference I am 26, never had kids and sought him out for sterilization. He went over all my options without judgment and helped me decide on fallopian tube removal surgery (bilateral salp). My surgery was at the Mayo Hospital and the whole staff was amazing. 10/10 cannot recommend him and his team enough.

[Shashank Srivastava](https://pvwomenscare.org/) took my uterus, cervix, and tubes out at age 28. I have 0 children. I am married. He has verbally said to me many times that he hates that other doctors try to be "paternal" and refuse sterilization for young women. Couldn't recommend him more!

A childfree friend had a hysterectomy with her at 34 for fibroids, and she was not judged either.

[Dr James Fishman](https://azurology.com/doctors/) - Performed NNNSV on 28 year old unmarried me with no bingos. Just did the usual confirmation question consult and day of procedure.

Office staff were above average for a doctors office too.

[Dr. Valerie Scholten with Desert Sage OBGYN in Phoenix Arizona](http://desertsageobgyn.com). I am 30 and recently married. I have been seeing WHNP Jill Lambert for some time, so the practice was aware that I did not want children. When I initially talked about sterilization with Lambert, the only pushback I got was that an IUD is a less invasive procedure IF I wanted to think about surgery a little longer (but not that I needed to). I returned four months later (post-Roe leak) to meet with Scholten and she approved me immediately—didn’t need to say any of my schpeal. She did make a strange comment about how you never know someone’s reasons “you could be bipolar!” (Which I am) which rubbed me the wrong way but I believe was said in good spirit. She said she has performed bI-slaps on women as young as 21.

[Dr. Gregory Desanto,](https://www.camelbackwomenshealth.com/) located in Phoenix, Arizona. I am 34, newly married, longtime childfree. Other doctors have denied me in the past for being too young. Saw Dr. Desanto to ask for bilateral salpingectomy. He made sure to clarify that it was permanent sterilization and asked if I was sure, and I after I told him I was, he went on the explain the details of the procedure and talk about scheduling-- no bingos, respected my decision. Very open to my questions and concerns. About a month between consult and procedure (but part of that delay was some communication issues with my insurance).

Doctor's statement:"I am an OB/GYN in Tucson, AZ who is willing to provide sterilization procedures for child-free patients age 18+. I typically will discuss alternatives to sterilization, and the increased risk of regret in those who do not have children or are under the age of thirty, as a standard part of informed consent, but will never outright refuse the procedure for someone who has made that decision."

[Dr. Holly Bullock](https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/Holly+Bullock/820421), She performed a bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 26, single, and forever child free. Dr. Bullock was absolutely amazing from the first visit all the way through surgery. She actually listens, made sure I had every bit of info I needed, and is very prompt about getting the forms submitted to the state (since AZ has a 30day mandatory wait). I LOVE that because she works at a teaching hospital, she actively goes out of her way to stop and explain to med students in the room how it's important to listen and advocate for the PATIENT and even explains to them how there are other doctors that will try to weasel patients out of having permanent procedures like these bc of personal beliefs. NB Dr Bullock will not sterilise below 21yo for insurance reasons.

I went in with a list of reasons why and with a partner willing to advocate for me. She said she supported my decision without hearing all the bingos and said my partner support is great but it's my body. I was shocked with her immediate support and understanding. Dr Bearden cared about my wants and made sure I understood what would happen with the procedure. She said there were better temporary methods but that since I wanted a permanent solution to my unwanted fertility, she would do the procedure. It was a 30 minute consult and I was able to sign waivers and set a date.

Dr. Matthew Kincade in Bentonville, Arkansas. He accepted my request for a vasectomy with very few questions. He did ask me my reasons and asked me a hypothetical question about any potential future partner wanting kids. But then after I answered he said that by the time someone makes it in for a consult with him that he figures they know what they want and understand what they're signing up for. He just asks the hypothetical to cover all of his bases. He was very friendly and straightforward throughout both the consult and the procedure itself. His office accepted my Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, although I can't speak to other insurance they accept or if they take on uninsured patients.

Jennifer Harris, APRN, and Dr. Suzanna Chatterjee-Morris of River Valley Obstetrics and Gynecology in Russellville, Arkansas were both amazing. I’d had a long-standing relationship with Harris and went to discuss removing and replacing my IUD when I decided to ask her about sterilization. She gave me the basic rundown and said, “as long as you and your partner are both sure, you sound like a great candidate.” I assured her we were and she set up a consultation with Dr. Chatterjee-Morris. My husband and I had a great consultation with Dr. Chatterjee-Morris who was very knowledgeable, open-minded, and clear. She answered our questions and we decided to do the procedure. I opted for a tubal ligation along with an ablation to stop having periods for the next 5-7 years. I just had the procedure done on Monday and everything went smoothly. I am currently recovering and definitely want to share this doctor with others as she seems very open-minded and progressive. She has a great bedside manner and absolutely reminded me of Mindy on “The Mindy Project.”

Dr. Diana Marie Spak M. D. from the southern California Kaiser Permanente network. She works out of both 12100 S Euclid St Garden Grove California 92840 and out of 3460 E La Palma Ave Anaheim California 92806. She approved me for the procedure in January when I went to her for a permanent sterilization consult (either via endometrial resection/ablation, a bisalp or both since I also have PCOS and had excessive periods that never really ended). She had a great bedside manner, was not patronizing or condescending (the way several previous doctors who had denied me in the past were) and just wanted to make sure I had thought it through but asked in such a way that avoided any bingos and remained respectful of my autonomy and choices. She advised that she would be willing to sterilize me (I was 28F CF, and unmarried with no kids).

Though I had my tubes tied in the past, I came to Dr. Hoang for a myriad of health issues. He performed a supracervical hysterectomy on me. My ovaries remain intact thankfully. 30 year old female, childfree and single. When discussing my health issues and past medical history, doctor asked why I had my tubes tied. I simply answered because I didn't like or want children, he said "okay that helps me to understand what we can do to help you without limiting our options." He listed to my concerns, he was very thorough and helpful. No hate for being CF! 

[Dr. August Accetta](http://augustdaccetta.com/) in Bakersfield, California. I'm 29 years old, single, and fully childfree. I did have to go to a single therapy appointment to assess my mental health (and then attend a second appointment to go over my results and get my clearance, but it wasn't a traditional appointment.)

In fact she was heavily pregnant when I first discussed sterilization options with her. The only thing she said was to remember that this was permanent but she respected my bodily autonomy and choices. I had a wonderful experience on the day of surgery and everyone was really kind, I wouldn’t hesitate recommending her.

+1 Dr Madhaven; I am a 27F that’s unmarried. I got a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. I met her in late October via video chat and she never bingoed me. I was also never bingoed by the staff at Alta Bates Hospital. They were very kind and professional.

[Dr. Amy Kane](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-amy-r-kane) - this is her sutter profile, but I was referred to her through LifeLong Medical Care. Location: Berkeley, CA Age: 32 Marital: single Status: childfree Summary: Zero "bingos." She was respectful. I needed to wait one month after signing a form due to Medi-Cal protocols. Through my insurance (Anthem Blue Cross Medi-Cal), 100% of my procedure was covered!

[Tami Rowen](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/dr-tami-rowen). My age is 32, unmarried (but in a long term relationship), childfree. No bingos from Dr. Rowen and she was very supportive. She said, "I'm not out to sterilize the world, but send people my way. The happiest people I know are those who do not want children and do not have them." I did get the sense that she was doubly fine with doing the procedure because I am over 30. That's not to say she wouldn't sterilize younger people though.

My husband and I are CF 26 years old and married for 3 years. Dr Rahman was so great! We were asked our marital status and if we had children when we answered that we had no children and no plans to he replied “excellent!” He explained medically how he would preform the vasectomy and what we need to do to make sure it is successful. We were given an appointment for the procedure that day no guilt or questioning from anyone in the office. Everyone we talked to at California Urology were so kind and professional and have made this experience so easy.

I received care with him 2022 through Kaiser. He will heavily suggest not to perform the procedure, but valued my own choice above his opinion. Be sure to be very knowledgeable and 100% certain you want this procedure and he may agree to do yours too! While he was a bit scary at first, once he knows there's no turning you away from the procedure, he becomes lighthearted, and I never doubted his abilities. I know of one other who was sterilized through him without kids. Eternally thankful for him and his team.

I made the appointments back in June 2022 (for November surgery) because Dr. Micks had a long wait for surgery. The entire process was smooth, I wasn’t questioned for my reasons or made to feel like I would change my mind. She was amazing. Surgery last week went well too and my entire surgery team were women.

Bilateral salpingectomy. 24 at the time of surgery, legally single (but in a relationship), CF for life. I had a phone consult with Dr. Kang in July or August of 2020. Due to COVID and school exams, I wasn’t able to have my surgery until May 2021. My insurance covered everything. When I had my phone consult with her, she said she just had to check through other forms of birth control with me as a procedure she could make note of that in my file I believe. Just a procedural thing even though she didn’t question my choices. When I explained why I wanted it she 100% supported it and didn’t question it. The day of the surgery my staff was great (like the resident, nurse, and anesthesiologist) and my recovery went swell too.

[Dr. Alicia Crecelius](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/southern-california/physicians/alicia-crecelius-6898458) Kaiser Permanente, West LA Medical Center/Playa Vista. Hysterectomy (removal of cervix and uterus) and bilateral salpingectomy, 31F, no kids, endometriosis. You will have to be very diligent in asking for her, my friend that tried to get an appointment spoke with a few reps that couldn't find her in the system for some reason. Explain that she is in both West LA and Playa vista kaiser centers. She will go through the routine minor bingos because she has to- will explain that there are other BC options, that this is permanent and irreversible, etc. Not because she doubts you but because it's standard to make sure you know what to expect. Make sure you explain that you know your stuff. You will have to sign a bunch of sterilization forms as well. She is stoic but very professional and a woman of a few words. She will take you seriously and she made my surgery painless and easy. I referred my friend that also got a bilateral salpingo from her and she is under 30.

[Dr. Miriam Mackovic](http://www.completewomencare.com/profile/dr-miriam-mackovic-basic/) (Bisalp for 25F. No bingos. Be well informed and you are set.

[Mary Louise Kiernan with Complete Women’s Care](https://completewomencare.com/doctors/dr-marilee-kiernan/). She did a combo Bi-Salp and ablation on a 24 year old with no kids not married with a partner of 4 years. Dr. Kiernan had the bi-salp done herself and was extremely supportive. She even utilized a method where she was able to take my cervix biopsy for the ablation while I was under for the bi-salp and had the sample quickly looked at while she was doing surgery, and was able to do the ablation right after and save me the trauma of getting a biopsy done while I was awake! (I hope that made sense).

LBGTQ+ friendly. Bisalp on 26-year-old redditor. When I originally went in to see her for the consult, I was 25 and in a relationship. I basically walked in and said “I never want kids and I want to be sterilized” and she said “okay, we can do a tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy”. Never questioned my decision, so supportive, couldn’t have asked for a better doctor.

Dr. Janelle Michiko Ogura - 25F, long term partner, no kids. Laproscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Got my surgery scheduled for a few months after asking for it. She did try to push an IUD on me instead of surgery and went over risks several different times. She also made me have an appointment with my psychiatrist/ needed psychiatrists clearance because I have mental health diagnoses in my chart. Overall they did a great job w the surgery.

[Dr. Sean Clare](http://www.mamg.org) (Bilateral salpingectomy/Laparoscopic sterilization on 23 Y/O Married CF F) Dr. Clare was amazing. I made a thorough binder which I submitted to the receptionist prior to my appointment and asked her to have Dr. Clare review it. During my appointment, he came in with my binder printed in hand. He had clearly read it through. No bingos or questions (my binder was very thorough, though) and he didn't acknowledge my husband until he was talking about surgery recovery and aftercare. Before that, he simply introduced himself and spoke to me directly about the surgery and what it entails. On my surgery day, he was very calming and completed my surgery in under a half hour. He also held my hand while I went "under" the anesthesia, which I found incredibly comforting as this was my very first surgery. He was extremely respectful and completely understood my decision to get the surgery, he had no doubts in me whatsoever. I can't recommend Dr. Clare enough. 

[Dr. Jon Lee](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/jonlee), Cleared me for a bilateral salpingectomy at 25, though he does not perform the surgery himself. I went in to my appointment ready to fight for a tubal ligation. I was pleasantly surprised when I told him what I wanted and he said “Okay, that’s your decision to make.” I signed a waiver and that was that. The office organized my surgery with a different OB/gyn and it cost me $0 with Kaiser insurance.

[Dr. Jennifer Hsia](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-jennifer-k-hsia) Palo Alto Medical Foundation, no bingos  (bilateral salpingectomy on 19yo)

+1 Dr Hsia "She is part of the Sutter Health network and I had a very good experience talking with her. No bingos as well, very fast and thorough scheduling. Originally I asked for just a tubal ligation (since I thought I'd get easier approval) but she was willing to do a full bisalp because it has a better chance of preventing pregnancy and ovarian cancer (I don't have a family history of Ovarian cancer either).

+1 Dr Hsia, Bilateral salpingectomy, 24 yo. Absolutely lovely experience. No bingos, just a 'You're sure?' and an invitation to join her long term study on the impact the procedure has had on my life 5 and 10 years down the line. Would recommend. Only waiting period was insurance mandated from Anthem and she deemed the procedure medically necessary so it would be covered. Eagerly waiting to give her my feedback in a few years.

[Dr. Andrea Aslan](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/andreaaslan) Bilateral salpingectomy, 21yo.

[Tabetha Harken, MD](http://www.ucihealth.org/find-a-doctor/h/tabetha-harken) (bi-salp 30F, no kids 07/2020) During the whole process they will call it a "tubal ligation" but they completely remove the tubes and cauterize the ends. No bingos besides what they had to ask on the risks/authorization. Due to my insurance (medi-cal/medicaid/ CalOptima) I had to wait 30 days after the first appointment to get the surgery. I was able to schedule the surgery and first consultation during the same call. I did not need an authorization by insurance to go here-I just called and scheduled.

Dr. Lao performed a bilateral total salpingectomy (complete removal of both fallopian tubes) in December 2021, and I was 23 with no children and unmarried. She asked why I was wanting to get one now I explained that I've actually wanted it for years but always thought there were restrictions like needing your husband's permission, and she looked personally offended. " From first appointment to surgery, just under a month, and Jimmy in billing was sent by the gods, bless that man.

**Oroville**

I am 27, divorced with no children. I have health insurance with Kaiser Permanente and I only had to pay a copay of $100. Dr. Sarah Morocco approved the procedure (she approved it during a 10 minute phone call talking about different forms of birth control and there was no pushback), but due to long wait times ( I waited 8 months from when I got approved,) a different doctor (Dr. Shant Ashdjian)is the one who actually performed the procedure (he didn't comment at all on my choice, just informed me about the procedure.)

I had previously visited another doctor in the same office but she could no longer do surgeries, referred me to Dr. Teng who agreed to do it without any fuss or explanation. Done at the Huntington ambulatory center which is a really nice facility and had a childfree pre-op nurse! 

+1 for Frances Teng. I went to her based on the recommendation above and got a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (26 F, no kids). I met her once, booked the surgery for 30 days later, and it was no fuss! Only complaint is that her receptionist is incompetent.

Dr. Fiona Redwood. I am married, don't want to get pregnant, ever. She sent me straight to surgery scheduling, the same appointment that I brought up wanting the surgery.

Bisalp on 41-year-old redditor. Dr. Salzetti was nothing but supportive of my decision, stating “Nobody should be allowed to make decisions about your body but YOU”. Three weeks from initial consult to sterilization in Fall, 2022. Extremely supportive bedside manner.  Post-operative pain was next to nothing.

**Redwood City** 

[Dr. Vivian Chu](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/vchu) in Redwood City, California. Procedure completed: Bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 18 (19 in November), have no kids, not married. Info about my experience: After our telephone consultation, she had me check-in with my therapist before proceeding with next steps, which could be because of my social anxiety issues and the fact that I was emotional over the phone with her (I was so passionate about my decision and didn't want to get denied). She also was obligated to bring up the study on the rate of regret for the procedure, but she didn't try talking me out of it, only had me acknowledge the risks.

**Riverside**

[Dr. Mallory Stuparich, M.D.](https://www.ucrhealth.org/doctor/mallory-stuparich-md/) UCR Health Inland Empire Women’s Health Center. NB this doctor has been hesitant in providing a hysterectomy for one of our members and has required multiple tests beforehand. 

[Dr. Rodolfo Saenz, MD](http://www.riversidemedicalclinic.com/) Riverside Medical Clinic (Essure on 26 F). Asked if I was 100% sure and accepted my answers quickly.

+1 for Dr. Rodolfo Saenz: (Tubal ligation on 25F) Didn't ask too many questions, and accepted my answers quickly. Very nice and supportive. He even sounded excited for me, which was nice.

Dr Karin Jones, bilateral salpingectomy for 27yo.

[Dr. Alison Slack at Sutter Roseville](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-alison-c-slack) 3 Medical Plaza Drive Suite 260 Roseville, CA 95661 T: (916) 773-7977 :: She does tubal ligations for patients as young as 21. I really like her and she did a great job.

+1 Dr Alison Slack, Bilateral Ligation Tubal and a Endometrial Ablation. I am 30, married, and childfree. My husband and my mom approve. I found Alison Slack on this list so I scheduled a consultant appointment with her. I was worried she was going to fight back or make me look at pictures of babies. All she did was go over my health and history, ask why I wanted to do this, and asked if I was 100% sure. She also asked if I was 100% sure once more in the Pre-op appointment. And that was it! It was very easy and she was very understanding and helpful. She suggested I get a Endometrial Ablation to burn the insides of my uterus to prevent heavy period bleeding for the next 2-5 years.

[Dr Amy Riley](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-amy-riley) and she works at Sutter Health in Roseville, California. I’m 30, no kids, and not married. The doctor asked if I’m 100% sure and that was basically it! Had me sign some consent forms and scheduled me for surgery. Tubal ligation. 

**Sacramento**

Dr. Joahnna Padilla, MD OBGYN 1321 Cottonwood St, Woodland California (suburb of Sacramento) (530) 668-2600. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 29yo single childfree woman. Dr. Padilla appreciated that I had done my research and that I knew there is a "workaround" for a bisalp (IVF). At pre-surgery appointment, I emphasized that I will never want children in any way. She checked in again before surgery to make sure I wanted to go through with it, but did not attempt to bingo.

[Dr. Juliana Melo](https://health.ucdavis.edu/team/obgyn/21785/juliana-melo---family-planning---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento) of UC Davis at age 44 in Sacramento, California for a bilateral salpingectomy. I have no children, and I’ve not wanted to have children ever. I have Blue Shield of California HMO insurance as a State employee. As OP is 40+ we would recommend our younger members use this doctor with caution. 

[Rachel Dong, MD](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/racheldong) - 33 Single Never had kids. I haven't had my procedure scheduled yet but it will be for a BiSalp. She's been my gynecologist for years and I mustered up the courage to ask her about sterilization. She didn't bingo me at all. She just asked me once if I was sure and she had me sign a consent form. Overall appointment only took about 10 minutes. I mentioned that it went a lot smoother than I imagined and she asked me why. I told her about the countless stories I've read about people being rejected. She laughed and asked if I was ready to fight and I said yes. She laughed again and shook her head. "No need for fighting. You're a grown woman and you can make your own decisions." I love her to death for that! I asked her if she would be willing to be put on the list and she was happy to be part of it. This doctor doesn't do the surgery herself but consults with patients before referring them for surgery. 

Dr Robert Gould, "I practice with kaiser Permanente in Sacramento/Roseville/Folsom. I know Drs Beyer, Nakamaru and Hong well (Hong is no longer operating ... wanted to focus her practice on office & OB). I am happy to care for LGBTQ+ patients and I offer gender-affirming procedures (hysterectomy +/- oophorectomy) for patients who are in our system and have been working with the transgender team here. I won’t do a sterilization on anyone under 18, but no marital restrictions."

[Dr. Melissa Lares](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/provider/melissalares) (bilateral salpingectomy) Works at Kaiser. Very nice, only asks questions to be sure you want it done. Doctor is transgender-friendly.

[Dr. Melody Hou](https://health.ucdavis.edu/team/obgyn/1569/melody-hou---family-planning---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento) Performed bi-salp on me, 23, CF/single. Amazing bedside manner, calm, and explained things in a way that was easy to understand. Validated my experiences and reasoning behind seeking sterilization. Zero bingos!

+1 Dr Hou, She performed a bisalp on me and I am 28F, unmarried, no children. Dr. Hou was wonderful throughout the whole process. She was kind, skilled, professional, and fun to talk to. No bingos at all.

[Dr Andrea Garland](Camelia Women's Health https://camelliawomenshealth.com/OB-Gyn-Sacramento) Sacramento, Roseville, Carmichael offices. Completed Bilateral Salpingectomy. No bingos, no trying to convince me otherwise. I'm a 34yo female. She said her only requirement was that someone be her patient for at least a year before she would complete it, which I had been for several years already for birth control. She was super supportive and understanding and went out of her way to come up with a plan to give me a new IUD to help manage my periods for another 5 years right before doing the sterilization so that my insurance would pay for both.

[Dr. Lindy Hong](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/lindyhong) Kaiser Permanente. 1650 Response Road
Sacramento, CA 95815 916-614-4055. Did bilateral salpingectomy on 25F. She didn't bingo me at all, she just asked if I was sure once and that was good enough for her. I could barely tell that I'd had surgery. I couldn't even tell that there had been a tube down my throat. I was able to go back to work the next day. 23 August 2021 - Lindy is no longer doing surgeries but was able to recommend our member to a new doctor. 

[Dr Christopher Bayer](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/christopherbeyer) Very respectful, no bingoes for a 23F but was unable to complete surgery for OP due to illness. 

+1 Christopher Bayer: Bilateral salpingectomy, 20f, in a relationship with boyfriend (23m), no children, “I think if you’re old enough to go to war and get a tattoo, you’re old enough to have this surgery.” Dr. Beyer was an amazing doctor to work with. He was very kind, supportive, and straightfoward with the process. He didn’t bingo me at all; in fact, he frequently made sure other nurses/doctors weren’t trying to bingo me when he wasn’t there. I was pretty nervous since this was pretty much my first surgery ever, but Dr. Beyer made this experience a very smooth one. I highly recommend him for anyone in the Northern California area!

[Dr. Nicole A. Nakamaru](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/nicolenakamaru) Despite never having met her I was comfortable with her, she was sweet, caring, with good humor. I got my surgery at 285 Palladio Parkway in Folsom, California's Kaiser, on August 16th 2021. The whole team (nurses, anesthesiologists, etc) was friendly and in good spirits. They said they've done 5-10 sterilization procedures on younger women my age every day lately, so they had a lot of experience; I was the 5th bisalp they completed that day. Dr. Nakamaru stitched me up very carefully and said she liked to make sure there was minimal scarring for all her patients. OP has offered some more information [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/p92229/new_cf_doctors_to_add_to_the_list_experience/)

**San Carlos** 

[Dr. Anjali Rao]( at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-anjali-rao), Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24yo, single, childfree. Did not care about age, no bingos, made the appointment and she explained the procedure to me and asked when I wanted to schedule the appointment, and was open to it being ASAP. Only downside is that any surgeries are scheduled on Tuesdays only. Anesthesiologist and all hospital staff are in-house so you don't have to worry about insurance difficulties with staff.

**San Diego**

[Planned Parenthood, Mira Mesa, San Diego County] (https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/california/san-diego/92126/mira-mesa-center-2333-90110) 10717 Camino Ruiz Suite 258, San Diego, CA 92126, 888-743-7526.  Bilateral salpingectomy on 32 and 37 year old redditors. 

+1 Planned Parenthood Mira Mesa, Jan. 2023. Bisalp on 22-year-old redditor. The consultation with the PP nurse (Stephanie Adamson, BSN, RN, PHN) went amazing and she sympathized with me that it was unfair so many older medical professionals have such “old school” ways of thinking that younger women can’t make those decisions for their body autonomy simply due to their age and lack of children. 2 weeks later i was set up with my pre-OP with the surgeon working with PP through UC San Diego’s hospital (Dr. Erin Shiv, MD), who was also amazing and incredibly compassionate, then 2 weeks after that i was in the operating room, tubes fully removed! 

[Dr. Janie O. Pak](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/southern-california/physicians/janie-pak-9585642), Bilateral Salpingectomy Age: 22 No children, not married (consult)

[Dr. John Stewart Kennedy](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/southern-california/physicians/john-kennedy-6022635), Bilateral Salpingectomy Age: 22 No children, not married (surgery)

Dr. Pak did my consultation. No bingo's, but I did have to wait for her to check with her colleagues on the ethics of approving me because of my age. They approved. Dr. Kennedy had an earlier surgery date available so I had my pre-op phone call with him and surgery. No bingo's from him. All went great.

[Dr Robert Christopher Scholz](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/southern-california/physicians/robert-scholz-2757095) from Kaiser to San Diego to the list. I was 25 at the time of the first consult. He listened to me, gently probed on past BC (tried pill, implant), cautioned that going off hormonal BC would make periods return as they were pre-BC. Valid medical concern, but not important to me. He never questioned reasoning, marital status, ago, never brought up regret. I was booked for a pre-op appointment within 2 weeks and had my bisalp within 3 weeks of the initial call. He was great all around.

[Dr. Martin Bastuba](https://www.sandiegovasectomycenter.com) provides no needle, no scalpel vasectomies. I am 24M, single, no children. He offers nitrous oxide (laughing gas) for an additional fee for those anxious about the procedure. The procedure was a breeze even without the gas. He has performed over 5,000 vasectomies in his long career. He is very easy to talk to and he and his team are supportive during and after the vasectomy.

And this is coming from someone who is deathly afraid of surgeries done on her. The doc was super responsive and would answer all my questions. and I sent *a lot* her way. And she would answer them herself and not a nurse of hers. And the OR staff were very careful and nice too. I didn't even have a panic attack! And that's a big thing, for me. The whole staff were extremely efficient and you could tell they were on it and cared for my well-being.

Warning: While the doctors from this health group are competent and won't ask you too many questions, the group is *extremely* disorganized and will reschedule on you. Source: Had my consult appointment rescheduled twice and my actual procedure reschedule on the day of. I would avoid unless you're truly desperate (even then, it will be a long wait).

[Dr. Erin Gross] (https://providers.ucsd.edu/details/11361/obstetrics-gynecology) Bilateral Salpingectomy. Preformed in 2020 on 30f. I had sterilsation on my mind; however, she offered it before I even asked. She asked about passed BC options I had used and what my futur life goals were partaining to the use of BC (basically asked if I plan to even be off of it to have children) before offering staralization. Brought the concent form in and informed me I can change my mind anytime before surgery, and that she is open to any questions as well. Very friendly and patiant. 

[Dr Kristin Engorn](https://www.wcobgyn.com/), West Coast OBGYN. When I first consulted with her earlier this month, the very first thing she said to me was "Your body, your choice." She did my (29F) bisalpingectomy this week and I am beyond impressed. 

[Dr Sarah Averbach](https://providers.ucsd.edu/details/32712/obstetrics-gynecology) Bilateral salpingectomy 25F married, no children I got a consultation in late June of 2021 and then had surgery Aug 2, 21 before moving. I have tricare and it was completely covered. She did push other bc options a lot and ask why i needed it/ its risky. I think just covering bases but not sure.

Carla Jean Stelling, MD in San Francisco, California. She is located at: Van Ness Campus MOB 1100 Van Ness Avenue Floor 4 San Francisco, CA 94109 415-750-7050.  She works through Sutter Pacific Medical Foundation. My experience with this process was so easy and straight forward. I have been trying to have this procedure done for years. I explained my family medical history, why I don’t want kids. She obviously went over the fact that this is an irreversible procedure and gave me the paperwork you have to sign before sterilization in the state of California. After, I waited the 30 days and got my surgery done. I never felt questioned or insane, I felt listened to and respected. It was one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had in regards to medical procedures.

[Dr. Gaetan Pettigrew @ UCSF, San Francisco, California](https://obgyn.ucsf.edu/gynecology/gaetan-pettigrew-md). I (27F, married, no children) had a total bilateral salpingectomy. Dr. Pettigrew (POC, LGBT) gave me no bingos at all, didn't even ask about my husband's opinion. He said he'd be happy to do it for me as long as I knew it was permanent and was sure it's what I wanted. He answered all my questions respectfully. My procedure went really smoothly at UCSF as well.

[Kien Chou](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-clinician/kien-w-chou?q=Kien&location=San+Francisco%252C+CA&zip=&lat=37.7749295&lng=-122.4194155&medical-group=&health-plan=&health-plan-product=). He is my primary GYN. The one who first mentioned a bisalp. Didn’t ask a single inappropriate question. Extremely inviting and sweet. Referred me to surgeon so I could ask more questions. 23yo F CF. 

[Katherine Hsiao](https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-katherine-t-hsiao?q=Katherine&location=San+Francisco%252C+CA&zip=&lat=37.7749295&lng=-122.4194155&medical-group=&health-plan=&health-plan-product=). This was my primary surgeon. Again, never asked any inappropriate questions. Signed consent form same day as initial appointment. Didn’t make me take time to think. Held my hand while I went under anesthesia. She can be hard to get in with because she does a lot of surgeries so I would start with gyno like Kien and then he will pass you to her. 23yo CF F.

[Dr. Paul Turek ](http://theturekclinic.com/)(Vasectomy) (Notes: Did not question my decision at all, and I'm 28, single, with 0 kids. He's expensive, but super skilled, experienced, and has made quite a name for himself in the field of urology.)

[Dr. Jeannette Lager](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/jeannette.lager) (bilateral salpingectomy for a 25 year old with 0 kids) - super cheerful, was very emphatic that this was my choice and that, as long as I felt confident going into it, she'd happily do the surgery. Any time I fell into justifying the decision, she re-emphasized that it didn't matter why I wanted to do it, as long as I wanted to. 

+1 Dr Lager, Bilateral salpingectomy, but was willing to do complete hysterectomy (unfortunately insurance didn't cover hysto so got salping). 34 years old, single, childfree. Appointment time was 2-3 months out. We chatted on zoom for half hour, she said let's go for it! Got surgery scheduled for 4 months out. Was in the hospital 7 hours pre/post op, but nurses told me the actual surgery took 34 minutes. Took Medi-Cal (PHP) insurance. SUCH a sweet, kind, understanding doctor.

[Dr. Rebecca Yee](https://www.pacgyn.com/our-doctors/rebecca-yee/) (bilateral salpingectomy for 34F, no kids) - Super nice, validating, went over all options. "I have to say this per the law, here are the possible consequences... But it sounds like you've thought this through, so when do you want this done?" She was surprised that I knew what a salpingectomy is. 15 minute appointment with her, before she approved me. 

+1 Dr Yee, bilateral salpingectomy 20F

+1 Dr Yee, San Francisco, California: bilateral salpingectomy for 22F, no kids * Super friendly and professional. I told her that I wanted the procedure done and had one scheduled (April 2020) except the pandemic postponed it, and then I moved states. She went over the procedure and confirmed that I thought about it and wanted to proceed. Otherwise, no questions asked. I was approved in mid June and the next surgery availability was end of July. Insurance fully covered the procedure ($10 co-pay).

[Erica Weiss](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/ericaweiss)- Total Hysterectomy. 21F, dating, very CF. Erica was wonderful. Once I got the referral and met with her, she asked me why I wanted this procedure. I said it was due to my CF status and the excruciating pain my periods bring. She just said "okay. Let's get you scheduled" and had me scheduled SAME MONTH. She is super kind and accommodating (and 420 friendly.) She forgot to take out my nexplanon while I was under anesthesia, but had it taken out while I was still drowsy and called the next day apologizing profusely. She is wonderful.

[Dr Mitzi Hawkins MD](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/dr-mitzi-hawkins) I received a full hysterectomy (removal of my uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes). I don’t take hormones because I still have ovaries intact. My doctor was great because she never questioned my desires for being child free. I told her what I wanted, told her my periods were really bad and she asked me “what do you want to do?” I told her I wanted a hysterectomy. She just said okay. "If this is what you really want, let’s do it.” Then she explained everything to me, the procedure, etc. She is a doctor at UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. After I had my procedure, everything went great. And then she told me to send my friends to her if they want the same thing. I think I paid around $1400-$1500. $400 for her separate MD fee & $1000 for the hospital. The hospital was able to give me a payment plan so it was so easy to pay off.

[Mareeni Stanislaus](Https://www.stanislausobgyn.com/) - I am a CF 26F and just had a bilateral salpingectomy from her. No fuss, no questioning me unreasonably.

I also offer sterilization transvaginally so there is no scar for a partner to see.”

**Santa Ana** 

Dr Stephanie Lao in Santa Ana, CA and she approved me for a bilateral salpingectomy within the first five minutes of meeting with her. 26 CF.  She said that she believes that adults can make their own decisions and just made sure that I knew there were other options and that I may regret it, but she said she HAD to say that. Super sweet, and so easy to talk to. Assured me the procedure is quick and easy (she said the actual procedure is only 10 min). Told me a story of how a patient had a "no-baby" shower afterwards!

I went to her seeking approval for a bisalp and minus the obligatory speech about alternative forms of contraception she just asked what I knew about getting surgically sterilized and which one I wanted (bisalp or tubal). She was non-judgmental and tried to get my surgery booked asap. She’s a great doctor who doesn’t ask any unnecessary questions, I definitely recommend her!

[Claudia Leiva, MD](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/claudialeiva21), Female. Dr. Leiva (Kaiser) was my surgeon for my bilateral salpingectomy and she was great!

**Santa Barbara** 

[David Raphael, MD](https://www.sansumclinic.org/find-a-doctor/doctor/profile/david-raphael) Bilateral salpingectomy for 37F. Anthem BlueCross insurance. No bingos. Asked if I was married (I'm partnered), and why I'd elect for surgery when my IUD is effective (I said because I want something permanent in case the regime changes or IUD is no longer an option, plus IUD doesn't confer lower ovarian cancer risk). Use with caution if under 30 as while OP feels the doctor may be open to sterilising younger people we do not have this confirmed. Also this doctor won't do hysterectomies on a purely elective basis.

I am 21F, and entirely childfree. Despite being late to my arrival time, I was treated extremely well during my entire visit. The lady who checked me in fought to bring my copay down to only $30 despite the initial hospital charge being $1000. Every nurse and doctor seemed genuinely invested in my care and safety, and were very respectful of my self-harm scars as well. I was only asked twice if I already had children, and when I said no neither of them pushed or even seemed surprised. They informed me every step of the way what was going on, and the total ordeal of driving there, waiting, getting poked, surgery, waking up, then going home only lasted from 10am-5pm. Recovery has been smooth sailing, I can't recommend this hospital and its workers enough.

I am 25f childfree, bisexual, and considered obese by the bmi standards at 5’5” and 230 lbs. Their whole team made me feel super comfortable, no judgement.

I went for my first visit, she came in asked how many kids I have and I said “zero” she just nodded and said “just don’t really want them then?” And I said “nope” to which she followed up with “okay, I can do this procedure for you.” She went into the risks and complications as well as reiterating that this is permanent because I opted to have my tubes fully removed instead of clipped or cauterized.

[Dr. Harley OB/GYN at the Colorado VA](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/) - bilateral salpingectomy. She was great. when discussing she just told me all the options and said she generally recommends bisalp because it lessens the potential for ovarian cancer and the possibility of growths on the pieces left behind from like a ligation. when i thanked her for not making it a fight to get approved, her response was “yeah i just really believe in autonomy.” This doctor only treats veterans.

[Dr. Chris Tonozzi](https://provasectomy.com/). He has offices located in Grand Junction, Glenwood Springs, Frisco, and Boulder (All cities in Colorado, United States). Vasectomy for 24yo, single childfree. There's no waiting period, and Dr. Tonozzi doesn't even require a consultation first, just get an appointment for the procedure! I experienced no bingos at all, and I even explicitly asked what he thought about my age and status, and his reply was "I know a lot of doctors give a hard time to young people like you, but I don't believe in that"

+1 Dr. Tonozzi "It took a whole five minutes for the procedure itself and was less painful than plucking a nosehair. The whole thing was just under $900. I texted Dr. Tonozzi to ask how he felt about operating one someone without kids and he had zero issue with it. If you're in Colorado, Wyoming, or Utah and are on the fence about it, please consider Go Vasectomy! You can make an appointment right on the website, no initial consults or long waits."

Gynecologist at Boulder Community Health that did a Bilateral Salpingectomy for both me and a friend (both 25 at the time) in 2020. He was more than happy to do the procedures for us and gave none of the usual resistance during the consultation, instead spending majority of that time just ensuring any misconceptions about the procedure were cleared up (i.e. it was a medical discussion and not a guilt one).

+1 [Dr. Jeremiah McNamara](https://www.bch.org/find-a-physician/jeremiah-e-mcnamara-md/) of Boulder Medical completed a Bisalp for me, just today! I am 27, I am recently married and together with my partner for 10 years, however, Dr. McNamara was already receptive before learning that. He was very interested in hearing that his name was on this list and was glad that it helped me find him. Child free since 16, never a pregnancy scare and staunchly on this side of the fence, as well as my partner. Super kind and receptive. Only lightly inquired about vasectomy for partner as it’s easier on the body but very quickly dropped it after assurance. From consult to procedure was 2 months. Every member on the team today was incredibly kind, professional. No bingos from start to finish.

[Doctor Stephanie Fowler](https://blueskiescenterforwomen.com/). Completed a Bilateral Salpingectomy and an Ablation for 28yo F, married, no children. Received no push-back from anyone in the office I spoke to. Only questions asked were to confirm I was aware of all my options and had considered them, and to check how set I was on hysterectomy vs making sure that my insurance would cover it. After discussing ablation myths, how effective it should be for me personally, recovery times, and how guaranteed my insurance was to cover either one I did agree that ablation should make me happy but never felt pressured by the doctor to make that decision, just sounded like she understood I was there talking to her specifically to try going through insurance and offered me a path to make that happen as smoothly as possible.

When I first saw Dr. Kuno, I brought a notebook with questions and the type of surgery I was comfortable with so I could double-down on that as needed. This was a very even-kiltered conversation for like 20 mins, he expressed that at 23 I could regret the procedure, but was never out of line in the why's etc. An L&D nurse friend of mine trusted him after watching him do procedures on other people. He told me from here he would submit approval for my surgery and get me on a waiting list.

Dr. Philpott and the nurse were both extremely professional, personable, and made me feel comfortable. There were no questions about if I had kids or bingos about if I might change my mind; no questions about my relationship status or anything else. He explained the procedure, the aftercare, the follow-up testing, and asked if I had any questions. The procedure itself went very smoothly (we actually chatted the whole time, which helped keep my mind off it). I highly recommend him and his office - this is exactly how a personal medical decision should go.

Dr. Megan Sheldon, D.O. Denver metro area. When I (28, CF)  told her I wanted to be sterilized, she did not ask any questions or challenge me at all. She did make sure I understood that it would be permanent. She was very supportive, and at the end of my consultation, she told me that she thought the sterilization procedure would be a great step for my reproductive freedom. I did go through with the procedure, and she was supportive from start to finish.

[Shawna Noelle Tonick](https://www.uchealth.org/provider/shawna-tonick-md/). I am a 27 year old AFAB person. I had my Bi Salp done this year. An ovary also had to be removed to preserve my health. She had to remove an ovarian cyst but agreed to remove both my tubes. I said I wanted it done and she did it. I have no children. I am married to a man, but when I asked her about if she needed something from him she responded that it was my body and my choice what I did with it and that if I was sure I wanted this she will do it. I didn't pay anything out of pocket, but that was because the ovarian cyst was the main focus. I found her through the Auraria Health Center, in Denver Colorado, which serves CU Denver, MSU Denver, and the University of Denver. She contracts out of CU Denver hospital in Aurora Colorado. Her main clinic is UC Health Women's Care Clinic. My insurance plan was MSU's Student Health Insurance provided by United.

+1 Dr. Goodman. Bisalp on 21-year-old redditor February 2021. He was the best and kindest I have ever seen. I scheduled an appointment with him after seeing him on the list. I had my initial appointment with him and had my tubal scheduled with him by the end of the appointment. This was at age 21. He said it sounded like I had done my research and thought critically about it and that if that's what I wanted he would certainly do it. (He is also the surgeon.) When I mentioned entirely on my own unprompted by Dr Goodman, that I had a spouse and that he was on board with my decision, he said something similar to 'I never asked about him, I asked about you.' Dr Goodman cared truly about what I thought was in my best interest and was a pleasure of a person.

+1  Bilateral Salpingectomy (Complete removal of fallopian tubes), 23yo. I found Dr. Saccomano from the CF Friendly Doctors list on this page, and confirm she was phenomenal the whole way through. She was the first and only doctor I met with, and made my procedure about a week after. I prepared a binder with pages also found on this page (Consent Forms, personal statement, etc) and brought it to my first appointment and she didn't even look at it. She was respectful and understanding of my choice to become sterilized, and was never once judgemental. Walked me through risks and concerns, but assured me the procedure was minimally invasive and never once hit me with bingos. If you are in the Denver area, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend visiting with Dr. Saccomano

Dr. Brenton Winship (Colorado Urology—Denver) to the list of colorado urologists who perform vasectomy with minimal questions asked. I am a 26 year old male with no kids and I was approved via telehealth appt for vasectomy with no exam and no questions asked. I’m 12 weeks post-op with successful results.

[Dr. Michael Moore](https://www.advancedgyn.com/#), HERS procedure (Hysteroscopic Endometrial Resection for Sterilization). I am 24, married, and childfree (no kids now, or ever). Dr. Moore was great to work with. He made sure I was well informed about the procedure, and all the possible risks, like with any surgery. I had my husband with me for support, but Dr Moore always talked to ME about my needs and desires. He was perfectly nice to my husband, but it was always clear that I was the patient and I was the one making the decisions about my body. No bingoes here. I highly recommend him.

Dr Sara Lillo - I (29F, single) got a bisalp and endometrial resection in 2022. She works with Victor Dabelea at the Consultants in Ob/gyn on 2055 N High St Ste 140 in Denver, Co. She's one of the rare doctors in the area who can do a resection (entirely removes lining) vs just an ablation (just burns the lining), so that's notable. I went in for a problematic returning fibroid and heavy periods/pain and I wanted to get sterilized at the same time, if possible. My previous obgyn only partially removed the fibroid (twice) in order to not dig into my lining, which would've reduced my potential for a healthy pregnancy. I asked Dr Lillo about a partial hysterectomy, and she just said, "if you're sure you don't want kids, we can definitely talk about options" and empathized that women often aren't believed when they say they didn't want kids after I said yes. She calmly discussed the risks of each procedure, made sure I didn't feel like I was being pushed into one procedure or the other, and answered all my questions about recovery. We decided on the resection + bisalp because the recovery time is lower, there's few risks, and the resection is a safer procedure (in terms of potential for ectopic pregnancy) in conjunction with bisalp. She and all her assistants were lovely the whole time and it was a great experience. Definitely recommend her.

+1 Dr. Lillo. I went to see her after finding her on this list. At my first appointment I said I wanted a bisalp and endometrial resectioning, and started to go into my spiel about why I don't want kids. She stopped me and said "I don't make women justify their decisions." After talking to her more about my options, I ended up going with a full hysterectomy, but she left the choice up to me. She has a great bedside manner and took time to explain things and listen to my concerns. Everyone in the office and at the hospital where the surgery was done were really great also.

Victor Dabelea, MD - Consultants in Obstetrics and Gynecology - Denver (303) 322-2240 Operates at Presbyterian St. Luke’s in Denver CO. Yesterday I had my bilateral bilateral salpingectomy done by dr. Victor Dabelea in Denver co. I am 31, unmarried, and child free. He only asked me once if I was sure. Last year he did everything same procedure for my also child free unmarried friend.

Ashley M Schinske, MD Hospital: Denver Health Medicaid Accepted: Yes Feedback: My discussion with Ashley back in April was very straightforward. There was no back-and-forth as to why I wanted the procedure done, only the expected discussion of pros and cons and the month long obligatory wait period before being contacted by a surgeon to schedule my surgery date.

**Delta**

[Dr. Brian Eades](http://www.deltahospital.org/getpage.php?name=Premier_Womens_Healthcare_Delta) Delta County Memorial Hospital--Premier Women's Healthcare. Told me that bodily autonomy is most important. Offered option of tubal ligation to me at age 25.

**Estes Park** 

[Martin Andrew Koschnitzke, MD](https://providers.eph.org/details/8/martin-koschnitzke_dr_k_md-obstetrics_gynecology-estes_park) who is in fact the only OBGYN here in Estes Park, CO. Didn't question my decision at all. Time between the consult and the operation was less than a month. The operation went very smoothly! 33 childfree. 

**Fort Carson** 

Sandra Bierling, bilateral salpingectomy, 26yo. Army doctor, she made sure I knew my other options, but said she supports patients and their bodies.

**Fort Collins**

Jessica Bare, DO. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I’m an OB/GYN at the Womens Clinic of Northern Colorado in Fort Collins Colorado. I’m very passionate about providing women with the option for sterilization procedures without judgement regardless of age or prior childbearing status."

[Dr. Elizabeth Buell, M.D.](https://www.doximity.com/pub/elizabeth-buell-md), Family Medicine Center, Poudre Valley Hospital (Vasectomy)

[Dr. Catherine Coffman, M.D.](https://womensclinicnoco.com/team-member/dr-catherine-coffman/), The Women's Clinic of Northern Colorado. She tied my tubes in September 2019 and at my initial visit, said "I dont do that 'must have x kids and be y years old' nonsense."

[Dr. Cheri Worford, M.D.](https://health.colostate.edu/), CSU Health Campus, Female Sterilization, (Doesn't perform surgeries herself any more but will lead you in the right direction to doctors in the area who are willing to perform on young women).

[Dr. Nicole Roberson, M.D](https://womensclinicnoco.com) She only asked to confirm if I was 100% sure of no kids. No other questions asked. Very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions.p

[Dr. Saskia Thompson](https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/Saskia+Thompson/517306), Banner Fort Collins Medical Center, 4700 Lady Moon Dr, Fort Collins, CO 80528. Also visits Banner Health Clinics in Wellington and Windsor. She's a great doctor that respected my decision and didn't try to persuade me otherwise. I got a Bilateral Salpingectomy as a 23 year-old woman with no children.

+1 Dr Thompson, I got sterilized via Bilateral Salpingectomy at 21 while engaged with my partner with no children. I got no bingos or trying to convince me otherwise. She warned me about risk of regret relative to age but told me it was my decision to make. She is very sweet and has the best bedside manner I have ever seen in a doctor.

[Dr. Tara Hoff at the women's clinic of Northern Colorado](https://womensclinicnoco.com/). Body-positive. I got a bilateral salpingectomy per the doctors recommendation. I am 24 unmarried no kids When I went for the consult the doctor just explained the procedure is permanent and cannot be reversed. She asked if i was okay with that and aware of other long term options. When I said i was certain with my decision she got me scheduled for about two months out.

+1 Dr. Hoff. Hysterectomy and bisalp on 24-year-old redditor. I first brought up removing my tubes and an ablation, but said I’d prefer a hysterectomy due to some symptoms I had and the desire to no longer have a period. I think she agreed to the hysterectomy because of my symptoms. She was a little hesitant at first, but still put me on a waiting list anyway. She thought I had endo and was just going to remove the tubes at first until she approved me for a hysterectomy. So bonus points she has knowledge about endo! And is willing to do exploratory surgery to find it and get rid of it. She was less comfortable with the idea of giving me an ablation though due to my age (24) and weight though.

Dr. Kevin Tool at the Women's Clinic of Northern Colorado in Fort Collins. I am 31 years old, single, and childfree. He explained the procedure in detail and asked if I had any doubts, said that some percentage of women regret sterilization. He wasn't pushy though and he didn't require any mental health checks. Just a covid test.

[Dr. Angela King](https://womensclinicnoco.com/team-member/angela-king/) - Bilateral Salpingectomy, 29 at the time (August 2021), single, childfree. My consultation lasted maybe 5 minutes. She asked if I knew that it was non-reversible, made sure I understood the surgery and that I would need IVF if I changed my mind. She never made me feel questioned or uncertain, my boyfriend came with me and she did not address any questions to him. I was immediately scheduled for ~2 months out. This was also billed as preventative care and I only paid ~$6 for the lab testing.

Melissa Reed, M.D at UCHealth Family Medicine Clinic. PCP who gave me a childfree referral for sterilization. Scheduled for total hyst from this referral

Dr Jennifer Stockburger. Her practice is Womens Clinic Fort Collins, and the procedure was performed at Poudre Valley Hospital through UCHealth. Total hyst and bisalp.

Dr. takes Colorado State Medicaid. Hysterectomy on 29-year-old redditor. He's a very efficient, right to the point kind of guy. He heard me out completely, talked through all the options, and in the end said he would support whatever I chose to do. I left my very first appointment with him with a surgery. Dr was comfortable with patient’s nonbinary gender. 

Dr. Heather Bourkovski. This doctor has reached out directly to advise, "I’m an OB/GYN physician in Grand Junction, Colorado.  I’m happy to perform sterilization surgeries on women over the age of 21 per state guidelines regardless of their status as a mother.   My clinic is Women’s Health Care of Western Colorado.  970-245-1168.  Please reach out if we can help."

+1 Dr Bourkovski, 29F childfree I was able to get my salpingectomy done by Dr Heather Boukovsk at the womens healthcare of western Colorado in grand junction. She was very professional was willing to hear all of my concerns. She was easy to get scheduled for the procedure and all in all made me feel like what I said mattered to her and was well respected. It didn’t even matter that I was a first time patient. She even showed me a picture of my inside showing the procedure was completed. I’m extremely happy and couldn’t have asked for a better doctor.

[Dr John Mercer](https://doctors.sclhealth.org/provider/John+W.+Mercer/1616549), 610 25 Rd, Grand Junction, CO 81505, at the SCL health medical group OB GYN. 970-298-9600. He approved me for a salpingectomy with absolutely zero pushback. I'm 28, unmarried, but I have had a miscarriage.

Dr. E. Lee Hardin GRAND VALLEY WOMEN'S HEALTH SPECIALISTS 603 28 1/4 Road Grand Junction, CO 81506 Phone: (970) 644-3190. Dr. Hardin tied my tubes when I was 32. He told me the day he agreed to it he performed the procedure on a 19 year old because he trusts women to make their own decisions. I had zero pushback and he was AMAZING through the whole process.

She was so supportive of my decision and went above and beyond to encourage and calm from start to finish. Never once asked "what does your husband think" or anything like that.

**Greenwood Village**

[Dr Michael Moore](http://www.advancedgyn.com/contact-us.html) did an endometrial resection on a 37 year old, and advised he would "have no issue offering sterilization to anyone 18+, as long as they were medically cleared for the procedure."

**Lafayette**

Andrea Burgess, MD Women's Health Group Lafayette, CO 80026 303-665-6016. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I don't put restrictions on patient age or parity. Insurance usually doesn't cover under 21. I am an ObGyn. I routinely do bilateral salpingectomies b/c of decreased cancer risk, hospitals that I operate at are Avista and North Suburban. Take most insurances, except for Kaiser."

[Colleen Begley, MD](https://whg-pc.com/), and I am an Ob/Gyn practicing in Lafayette, Co. Since the Dobbs decision, there has been an influx of requests for tubal ligations from patients concerned with losing reproductive options. I wish to add my name to this list of docs who will perform a tubal on any freely consenting adult with fallopian tubes, regardless of her parity. 

[Dr. Rachel Stacey](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/colorado/clinicians/rachel-stacey-7594755). Procedure: laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Late 20s, long-term relationship, Childfree. Kaiser as a practice is hit-or miss on doctors and nurses trying to bingo you, but Dr. Stacey was adamant that it's my choice and she doesn't need to vet my reasons. She made sure I understood the risks of the surgery itself and had a plan in place for my recovery. I had a short timeframe due to my insurance plan changing and she made sure I was a high priority and accommodated me (within 6 weeks of initial request). Insurance cost for my plan was a flat $500 for the procedure + pain medication for after (~$20).

+1 Dr. Rachel Erin Stacey, Bilateral salpingectomy for 28yo. Kaiser fully covers lap bisalp under preventive care (ovarian cancer). Never got a bill. Dr. Stacey was 100% supportive no bingos because I came prepared (i.e., I knew it was permanent, was clearly childfree and knew what I was asking for, etc.). My regular GYN bingoed me when I asked but gave me a consult with Dr. Stacey anyway. It took 4.5 months from consult to procedure.

**Littleton** 

[Jessica Salinas MD](https://www.centura.org/provider-search/jessica-salinas-md Littleton, Colorado, USA). She completed my hysterectomy (removing the uterus, both fallopian tubes, and cervix) on Tuesday, May 17th. Age 37 Married with no kids - childfree by choice. Dr. Salinas is a joy to work with. She originally suggested a bi-salp when I mentioned permanent birth control, but I told her about my painful periods & my family's history with fibroids, and she agreed right away that a hysterectomy would be better. No bingos, no concerns at all. After my first visit with her, we were able to book the surgery to happen 2 weeks later. I had completed my deductible with my insurance company for the year, so insurance paid for 80% and I paid for 20%, which was under $400. Best money I've ever spent. Dr. Salinas and her whole team were very extensive with details on how to prepare pre-surgery and how to recover post-surgery. They even insisted on a pre-op ultrasound, where they found I had a large fibroid no one knew about.

**Lone Tree**

[Heather M. Fitzler, M.D.](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/colorado/clinicians/heather-fitzler-8784056#medical-group-link-section) (Highlands Ranch/Lone Tree) at Kaiser Permanente- Dr. Fitzler approved a bisalp for me (34/single/no kids), at my very first appointment. Very pro woman’s right to choose, and no bingos from her or surgical staff. Time between my approval and surgery was two months. It was a great experience, definitely recommend her if you are in the Kaiser Permanente insurance network and can get to her office.

[Dr. Kirigin Watkins](https://www.avistawomenscare.com/staff/kirigin-e-watkins-md.html). She performed a bilateral salpingectomy and gave me no pushback or negativity during consultation. Barely any pain. 10/10 would do again. 34F. 

**Loveland** 

[Dr. Sarah Vrabec](https://www.uchealth.org/provider/sara-vrabec-md/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 29F, in a relationship, child free. I had a consult with Dr. Vrabec after roe v wade was overturned. We talked about how I never wanted kids, and she did want to make sure I was making this decision not just out of fear for the ruling, but after that was smooth sailing. No bingos from her staff or her. Waited a few months for surgery booking, took less than a full day to complete. 

**Pueblo**

[Dr. Alan Bickel](https://www.parkviewmc.com/doctor/profile/alan-bickel/) 4100 Jerry Murphy, Suite B, Pueblo, CO 81001, 719-542-1500. April 2023. Vasectomy on 29-year-old CF redditor. The nurse assisting was curious about my motives but never questioned my decision. 10/10 would recommend.

**Westminster**

[Dr Faye Sundahl](https://www.centura.org/provider-search/faye-sundahl-do) recently did my unilateral oophorectomy and bilateral salpingectomy along with total hysterectomy. She is the first doctor to take me (27F) seriously about this, and had no hesitations regarding my unmarried, childfree status. She just asked me questions to make sure I had considered all options and was positive this was the course I wanted to take. NB OP has had longstanding issues with pain and bleeding. 

+1 Dr Sundahl, She performed a bilateral salpingectomy (complete removal of Fallopian tubes) in April 2022. I am 28 years old, in a long term relationship (not married), and childfree with no other reproductive health concerns. Dr. Sundahl (and her nurse) was kind and understanding from my first visit (first time obgyn visit + sterilization consultation same day in February 2022). No bingoes, but she did inform me of ALL forms of birth control from abstinence to permanent sterilization just to make sure I knew my options. Otherwise was very understanding and non-judgmental with me. Was able to schedule my surgery, pre-op, and post-op appointments a week after my initial consultation! She also provided me with before and after pictures showing tubes/no tubes at the hospital immediately after my surgery, which gave me great peace of mind.

[Dr Edusa](https://www.bridgeporthospital.org/physicians/valentine-edusa.aspx). Essure, Tubal Ligation, Hysterectomy, birth control including Mirena, ParaGard, and the pill.

+1 Dr Edusa, total hysterectomy, 29, unmarried, no children. Husky D is accepted and covered the entire procedure due to having a bunch of issues (endometriosis etc). He's kind, informative and not judgmental. I waited a year and a half to get procedure. Originally was going to do bisalp, but since I was still adamant about a hysterectomy, we did that.

**Farmington**

[Dr. Rostkowski](https://www.womenshealthct.com/practices/comprehensive-gynecology-of-ct-formerly-fine-and-gillette/) - I'm 37 year old single, child-free by choice, I had a bisalp 3 years ago. The entire practice is wonderful, they just do women's health, no pregnant women or deliveries. (I realized one time when I was in there that there were no pregnant women around and I asked and she said that they don't do that lol ). I was never bingoed, asked if I was sure, told i needed spousal permission (I'm single), or told I would regret it. The entire process was explained to me thoroughly and I was treated respectfully. OP advises that she expects Dr Rostkowski to be open to sterilising younger women. 

**Hartford**

[Dr. Emily J. Rosenbush](https://www.womenshealthct.com/) [Women's Health Connecticut], Bi Salp - 24F childfree and married. I started seeing this gynecologist in late 2020 (I was unmarried at the time) when I was thinking about going the permanent route through sterilization. I wasn't quite ready to schedule but I wanted to establish care with one of the childfree docs. I was asked a couple variations of the "Are you sure?" before she dropped that entirely and told me when I was ready she would schedule the surgery, and I imagine she asked the questions mostly for due diligence reasons. I have found her to be a caring and compassionate provider even outside of this procedure.

Dr. Odin Kuiper, of Glastonbury, and Hartford [Women's Health Connecticut]. I saw him at 100 Retreat Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut, 06106. I'm 35, married, and childfree. When discussing the procedure, he asked me once, "do you want children?" And I said "no" and that was that. He didn't ask me about my husbands wishes, or require his verbal permission. He never asked any follow up questions either (about children). He was also willing to do the bisalp on it's own, if I wanted to keep my ovaries - which I didn't.

Offices are in Meriden (in the Midstate Medical building) and Wallingford Connecticut. Surgeries are performed at Midstate Medical Center in Meriden. He also works with the local Planned Parenthood to help women get sterilization services. He will work with insurance, even State insurance. I had been trying to get a ligation and ablation for 15+ years. I was in my early 30s, unmarried, no children. Dr. Fanning was fast to get an appointment with, professional, and actually listened to and validate my concerns. I had the surgeries done separately- ligation first, did a biopsy to check for fibroids- then ablation 3 weeks later. It was a great, non judgemental, experience.

**Middletown**

[Dr. Ozbek](https://middlesexhealth.org/find-a-doctor/aysegul-ozbek-md) in Middletown, Connecticut. I (26F, no children) was referred to her by my GP. My IUD was expiring in a couple months and I wanted to pursue a permanent birth control option. Had a fairly quick consult with a PA and then Dr. Ozbek later the same visit. She discussed reversible options but wasn’t pushy one way or the other and supported my decision for sterilization, commenting on how common it was becoming. She explained that she performs bisalps as they have the most benefits/efficacy. We postponed scheduling right away as I was having another unrelated (hip) surgery soon after the consult. Once healed enough from the hip surgery, she contacted me before I got around to calling her office to let me know she had an opening the next week. She confirmed I wanted a bisalp rather than ligation (which could potentially be reversed) before surgery. Surgery was quick, and uneventful.

**Norwich** 

[Dr. David A. Kalla](https://www.obgynct.com/) 17 Case St Norwich, Connecticut 06360 860-886-2461. Bilateral salpingectomy. It took about a month and a half for an appointment to see Dr. Kalla. I am 34 & have never wanted children. I brought my husband along just in case. I told the doctor-short & sweet-“I want my tubes tied, I don’t want there to be any chances I get pregnant.” And all he had to say was, “that’s fine, it’s your choice.” (Also, he only does the full tube removal) He did mention that it would be easier for my husband to get a vasectomy, but it seemed like he was just pointing out the obvious medical truth, not trying to push me away from my choice. I told him I wanted to take care of it on my end, and that was that. I waited about another month for a pre-op appointment. 3 weeks later, I went to the hospital to have my laparoscopy same day surgery. I’ll have my post-op appointment about a month after the surgery.

No bingos, only confirmed that I defiantly didn’t want kids and that I was aware the procedure was permanent. She was very knowledgeable and open with information. 10/10 would recommend.

He does not provide abortion services, but will not judge if that's a choice you make, and will refer you to PP] (Bisalp scheduled for 31/f patient of 12 years on 11/6/19) 

**Stamford** 

[Dr Sarp Aksel](http://www.coastalobgynct.com) - This gynecologist has contacted us directly to advise, "I take almost all commercial insurances as well as Medicare/Medicaid. If they are legally of age to give informed consent to any surgical procedure in the state of Connecticut, I’m more than happy to assist them. I do however require a consultation for intake and thorough discussion of all options — so I don’t book salpingectomies without an intake visit."

[Dr. Antonios Panagiotakis](http://www.coastalobgynct.com/antonios-j-panagiotakis-do) Bilateral Salpingectomy 33, married, never wanted kids, never had them, childfree for life. No waiting period. Met with him for an annual at our first meeting, mentioned I wanted a BiSalp, called next day and got me in for surgery 10 days later. Excellent bedside manner. Did ask if I had talked to my husband about a vasectomy, but said that he needed it for the insurance paperwork. If you have Husky insurance, he said with that insurance there is a waiting period, but no wait for private insurance. Body positive too. 

-1 Dr Panagiotakis, required waiting period and bingoed however OP did request a hysterectomy, not bilateral salpingectomy. You need to be well researched and able to tolerate bingoes to work with this doctor.

[Dr. Sarah Graceffa, OBGYB Associates of Eastern CT](https://obgyneasternct.com/) - Bilateral Salpingectomy, 26F, not married but with long term boyfriend (5yrs). I told her I was no longer comfortable with hormonal birth control or an IUD and asked for tubal ligation or other sterilization procedure. She had no objections since we had discussed it before and she knew I wish to be childfree. She did mention that there was a high rate of regret in patients under 30 to make me aware, but not in a way I felt pressured to change my mind. Ultimately I opted for a salpingectomy rather than just a ligation, and she offered me both options with no judgment for what I chose.

Bilateral tubal salpingectomy (fallopian tube removal). She asked qualifying questions: why I am looking for a tubal, why I don’t want to have children, is there any chance for regret, and why contraceptives like pills or IUD isn’t an option for me. After answering she gave me a date for surgery -covered by insurance (except for copay’s) under Aetna -the anesthesiologist offered me a local block to prevent pain in my abdomen, so I had very little pain while healing

+1 Dr Curington, I am 26, unmarried with no kids. Dr. Curington is super cool and didn't bingo me at all, and in fact agreed with many of my reasons for wanting a vasectomy and told me that he got his at a similar age for almost the same reasons. My reasons being, the current climate crisis, political and racial tensions across the country, and the fact that I've just never wanted children. That said, Dr. Curington and the receptionist at his Port Orange office are the only ones I really had contact with, so I am unsure if any of the staff at different offices would provide a different experience. I paid out of pocket, which costs $590. There was no wait when I arrived at his office about 15 minutes early. I don't have any experience on the insurance side of it since I paid put of picket, but there is an informational section on the website that says what insurances they don't accept and have had issues with before.

I went to Dr. Bhardwaj in May right after the Roe v. Wade leak asking to be sterilized. She only asked why I wanted to get this done now. I said I wanted to make this decision for myself before I might not have the chance to. She agreed, the surgery was scheduled for June 24. And I got it done yesterday. I'd like to add her to the list.

**Boca Raton**

[Dr. Kenneth Konsker](https://www.lucinawomenshealth.com/), He did an endometrial ablation on me at 26, and when I started having issues a few years after that due to weight loss, referred me to a surgeon for a complete hysterectomy. When I was going through the discussion for the ablation, he commented about it being my body and my choice, that he willingly does a tubal on women if they want it. He is a fast talking New York native so appointments can feel a bit rushed, but he absolutely listens and is as worried about a woman’s quality of life as she is about it. 

-1 Dr Konsker, another member advises she was refused sterilisation by Dr Konsker unless she passed a psych evaluation first. 

~1 Dr Konsker, I was seeking IUD removal + TL via biasalp + ablation. He was very nice and treated me like a VIP but referred me to another provider, Cecile Walker, for the surgery. I’m in my late 30s, no kids. He was understanding and didn’t bingo me or anything. I am not sure why he referred me out but thought this might be useful so people don’t waste their time going to him for a consult or at least know that they will likely get referred to Dr. Walker.

-1 Dr Walker, the receptionist will tell you she doesn't sterilise women without children. It is as yet unclear if this is an age related issue or a receptionist issue. 

**Bradenton** 

[Dr Marion Pandiscio](https://www.manateegynecology.com/) Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am a 26 y/o cisgender woman with no children. I ended up having cervical dysplasia, and needed a procedure for that. This could be why it was so easy for me to get sterilized. The first NP I spoke with tried to dissuade me, she told me that I should get another IUD. When i spoke with Dr. Pandisico, she did not question me at all and immediately agreed to perform the sterilization because she could tell i was serious and had thought about it a lot. i did not have to do counseling but she did thoroughly explain the procedure and told me it would be very difficult, but maybe possible, to reverse.

+1 Dr Pandisico,  She works out of Manatee Gynecology, which is an all-woman gynecology practice that doesn’t deliver babies at all. I am a childfree 26 year old (25 at time of consultation and surgery) and experienced absolutely no resistance when asking about the procedure. All she said was “so you don’t want kids? That’s okay it’s not for everyone!” and scheduled me. My sterilization request also was never questioned by the gyno who I saw before consulting with my surgeon. My surgery was performed at Blake Medical Center and cost about $800 out of pocket with my Florida Blue insurance covering the rest.

+1 Dr Pandisico, I'm 26F, single with no sexual history, no reproductive health issues. Sarah Billman is the one who did my annual exam and referred me for my bisalp consult. Dr. Pandiscio never questioned me once and was super thorough in explaining the procedure and benefits of bilateral salpingectomy. Everyone there made feel like it was my choice that I was empowered to make. I can't recommend her and Manatee Gynecology enough!

I just went in and said that’s what I was seeking. She did go through everything making sure I was aware of risks and permanent and offered a iud and arm implant. She was very thorough and went through my reasons and past birth control etc. Signed the consent form same day as my first appointment, and made sure I knew I could change mind at any time even day of. She was amazing and answered everything I needed to ask. She is so kind and said if insurance covered she would take full tubes.

She asked my marital status; at the time I was married and my husband was not present at the visit. She asked his thoughts and I said he was also childfree. I was required to sign a consent form, then return two weeks later for my pre-op appointment, confirming my continued commitment. Procedure was smooth, scars are gone, Dr. Phan was nothing but compassionate and supportive. Five stars.

Doctor’s statement: If you need some reliable contraception (especially a LARC device like an IUD or Nexplanon), I am always taking new patients. This is a scary time for women so I just want you all to know you have support in me. I do offer tubal ligation/salpingectomy (removal of tubes) even if you have no children and/or you’re young if you know that is what you want! Autonomy is important!

I will gladly perform sterilization and hysterectomy for those who feel it is the best decision for them. No, I don’t need to talk to your 'significant other'.  I don’t care how old you are. I just care that you understand the risks for surgery and we’re good to go.  " 

Dr. Lauren Juyia - OBGYN - Clearwater, FL - Elite Women's Care One of the few gynos near me (F25) who accepts my not so great (Oscar) health insurance. I came into my consultation with her fully expecting to have to argue my patient rights and ability to make permanent decisions. I made a folder to look more serious and expected to be shot down. I didn't need the folder or any argument, I told her my IUD was giving me extra long/bad periods, she suggested I try the copper IUD, I said I really don't want another IUD because getting mine inserted was traumatic. So we talked about salpingectomy vs ligation, and after an educational conversation with her I opted for the fold & band tubal ligation. She was really nice and easy to talk to and my tubal yesterday went great.

Dr Tali Rombro in Coral Springs. Had a consultation with her in July. She explained to me all the risks, how the procedure will go, and offered me alternative options but when I said I was still adamant about getting a bilateral salpingectomy she respected my wishes! Got the surgery in August and healed up. Never judged me and always treated me with respect.

Dr. Daniel Gomez of Royal Palm OBGYN in Coral Springs, FL. Dr. Gomez did not give me any bingos and didn’t even need to look at the sterilization binder I put together or hear my reasoning; he was happy to provide the procedure after he asked how long I’ve been considering sterilization, reiterated the permanence of it, and pointed out the risks of surgery. I went to the office asking for a tubal ligation but Dr. Gomez prefers performing bisalps because he likes lowering your cancer risk and chance of ectopic pregnancy.

+1 Dr Coates Feb 2023 Bisalp on 32-year-old redditor. He had great bedside manner as well and didnt ask me any questions except “ligation or salpingectomy?" He said “I don’t care what anyone’s reasons are or how many kids they have; if they want their tubes tied and are over 21, I do it.”

Dr. Coates' own statement: "Happy to perform tubal sterilization procedure for anyone who does not want any children (or any more children)! I do perform bilateral tubal occlusions and bilateral salpingectomies in patients that are 21 y/o or over, as long as medically cleared for the procedure. They need to be adequately counseled and informed, but I perform them on patients that have never been pregnant. I feel strongly that this is their decision to make. If they have Medicaid, there is a consent that they have to sign that has to be signed for over 30 days and then is good for 6 months. I am LGTBQ+ friendly, however, do not offer gender affirming procedures. I have no marital status limitations, however I will ask about possible future desire to have a baby, as it is part of informed consent due to the possible risk of regret. I am a hospital employed physician, but have not encountered any resistance with scheduling these procedures. I think that we take all insurances, however, some may require a referral from their primary care."

[Dr. Frank Cirisano](http://www.womenscancercare.com/about.html) He did my complete hysterectomy for me at 29. It was emergent, with complications, so I do not know how he is for a woman without issues. It never came up as explicitly as it did with Dr. Konsker. I do feel good about recommending him because he never tried to do something like “you have to save your eggs/ovaries”  pre surgery and he only talked about trying to save an ovary to prevent surgical menopause, nothing about future kids.

[Joseph Iobst, M.D.](https://www.allaboutwomenmd.com/staff-joseph.html) - He gave me a few bingoes like what happens if you meet a partner that wants kids and maybe we should wait a few months but whe I held my ground and told him I've wanted this for years and have no plans to breed he conceded and recommended a bisalp for me at 29, single, never married and no kids. It was 90 percent covered under my insurance but the amount they billed my insurance was close to 50k if memory serves. He's not the friendliest or warmest person but he's very practical and logical and down to business. If you return that energy you will have no problems imo. 

[Dr. Anthony B. Agrios, M.D.](https://www.allaboutwomenmd.com/staff-anthony.html) Had some qualms about performing sterilization on 24 y/o AFAB and asked questions, but did insist that if it was the right thing for the patient that he would do it, and he did. He is a great and caring doctor. Tubal was offered but he gladly did a bilateral salingectomy instead. May need further convincing for younger patients.

+1 Dr Agrios, 23F bilateral salpingectomy. I am plus-sized, and behind discussing the risks of being overweight at our very first consultation, it was never brought up again and was never an issue throughout the process of having the sterilization done. I know I was anxious about whether that would be a problem, so I was thinking it would be a helpful detail to add for any other plus-sized person seeking sterilization in the area.

Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy - 28 years old, married, no children & no desire to have them (birthed, adopted, or otherwise). I asked to be sterilized. At first, she gave me a speech about how it's permanent ("23 is too young for this kind of permanent decision") and recommended an IUD. She also told me that people regret this decision and that I was too young to decide. However, she had misread my chart and once I pointed out that I was 28, she very quickly acquiesced. She informed me about the possible risks and complications. I told her I still wanted it, she said "okay, my nurse will contact you to set up a date for surgery." Do NOT consult with this doctor if under 25. You'll be rejected.

I'm single. I told him that besides not ever having wanted children, the fact that I was likely to die in childbirth (he knew this) made that question absurd.

[Dr Sean McCarty](https://www.wcorlando.com/provider/sean-mccarty-do) - 23/Bi-salp

+1 Dr McCarty, Dr Sean McCarty was absolutely incredible. Very straightforward and immediately said “I am going to help you” before he even walked me through the options. Asked his receptionist to create a sooner follow up for me and was willing to stay late to get my obligatory second appointment over with. He is very against what’s happening in politics now and truly was excited to help me.

+1 Dr McCarty, tubal ligation Im 22(f). Its been 3 years of trying to find a doctor that would listen. And he allowed me to cry, gave me multiple options and never tried to persuade me otherwise or use age as an excuse.

+1 Dr McCarty, I want to get a tubal ligation and I was all ready to present my case to him about my bad periods, mental health, ect. He didn't even ask! He told me it is my body and my choice. He explained all of the different procedures I could have instead if I didn't want to go permanent.

-1 Dr McCarty, He would not entertain discussions regarding other options of permanent sterilization. 

[Dr. Maegan Lubbers and Dr. Matthew Mervis](https://primeobgyn.org/), I’m 35, single, and decidedly childfree. I had an issue with Fibroids and Dr. Lubbers was the one that SUGGESTED Sterilization after another doctor recommended more conservative measures. She performed both my salpingectomy and my hysterectomy without hesitation. Dr. Mervis works in the same office. He did my friend’s salpingectomy without any question or hesitation. She is also childfree, single, and was 37 at the time. Use this clinic with caution if under 30.

[Dr. Evelyn Morning](http://www.ob-gyncaregroup.com/providers/) (I went in looking for an IUD for long term BC. She SUGGESTED sterilzation. I was 33 and in a long term relationship. Due to a scheduling miracle I was fixed within 2 weeks from my initial appointment. Loves discussing my tattoos and travel plans)

-1 Dr Morning, I (26F) was denied a tubal ligation as she said she does not do ligations for people under 30 and because of my BMI being too high.

Dr. Sea was extremely professional, cheerful, and listened to all my concerns. Procedure was $900 upfront, with my insurance (Cigna) covering $800 of it after submitting the claim. The surgery center he used put me under general anesthesia, instead of using local anesthesia.

I was referred to Dr. McCarty by my normal OBGYN. I had mentioned wanting to find a woman surgeon who would not cause me any roadblocks, but she told me she would refer me to Dr. McCarty because he was a "guaranteed yes". When I met with him for the first time, he asked if I had considered other long-term options such as an IUD. After I expressed my desire to no longer be on hormonal birth control, he agreed, and made it clear that his patients' autonomy was something that was very important to him. I had my surgery within three weeks.

I was taken seriously, no bingo-ing, only an informative "this is irreversible and permanent, if you want biological children after you will need to have your eggs harvested" and information related to what the surgery entails. In and out in half an hour. She told me that I'm an adult and I can make medical decisions about my own body. She did tell me that younger patients 18-21 may not be eligible for such a procedure until a patient-doctor relationship is established unless there is medical indication that it is necessary, as it could reflect on her and her licensing negatively. I'm 31 and type 1 diabetic, she emphatically agreed that pregnancy would be bad for me.

Dr. Reda Alami, at a Flagler hospital, gave me a tubal ligation after a single discussion and a pre-op visit. The only questions asked were if I were married (I was divorce,) what my age was, (I was 31,) and if this is something that I had seriously considered. When I said that this is something I'm seriously interested in, he said that he would do the surgery for me and then gave me the statistics on how many people end up regretting it. (But not in q rude way.) He also emphasized that it was a permanent procedure, but he gave me no additional resistance. Recovery has been smooth so far. Surgery on Thursday with 1.5 procedure time. Back to full activity Monday. Pain managed with 800mg ibuprofen, and he removed my IUD at the same time.

She asked me once if I was absolutely sure, but it was less of an attempt to get me to say no and more of a confirmation of consent. Never bingoed me once (but did say she might have hesitated if I were 18/19). Friendly, laid-back, very easy to talk to about specifics and concerns about the procedure.

+1 Dr Haddock, she is FANTASTIC. Not a single bingo - just asking if I was sure with my decision. I’m 27 and she had no issues with scheduling me for a bisalp after our initial appointment. She is childfree herself and it was awesome to have someone actually listen to me for once. She took time to make sure I was comfortable before the procedure and make plenty of jokes to keep me smiling before I got wheeled into the OR. She also does her bisalps through an outpatient surgery center and every employee there is a fantastic person. My experience was fantastic and I’m so thankful for them and their help. I’m happy to say I’ll keep going to Dr. Haddock for my regular gyno needs, too. She’s a pleasure to work with.

Very professional, not judgmental at all, merely explained the procedure and its permanence, didn't ask about romantic partner or anything, and emphasized it was my decision.  

+1 Dr Sacks. He asked a ton of good medical questions. No bingos. I asked HIM if he ever asked/had rules on age, how many kids, marital status, etc., out of curiosity. He said absolutely not, and that he practices "patient-centered" medicine and respects our decisions/autonomy. He asked if I had had prior docs ask such questions and if that was why I had asked him, and I gave examples of bingos. He seemed genuinely disturbed by the bingos and said that those questions were "inappropriate" for a doc to ask a patient. He said he had no issues with performing surgery on someone in early 20s, no age minimum, no child minimum, etc.

Extra points for taking pain symptoms seriously and performing a full assessment. 39 yr old. Bilateral salpingectomy. Surgery covered by insurance, but unfortunately I'm responsible for 20% coinsurance, which in my case is almost 3k. This includes hospital, doctor and pathology, as well as anesthesia. It only took weeks from initial consultation to surgery. I've been in Florida got 20some years and have been searching for a doctor to perform this for at least the last 20. I really hope this info can help someone else get help sooner. Use with caution if under 35, as this doctor may not be as supportive for our younger members.

[Dr. Camille McPherson, M.D., F.A.C.O.G, Women's Center of Athens](https://womenscenterofathens.com/office.php) Bilateral laparoscopic tubal ligation for 25 y/o. Gave approval on first visit - respectful but hesitant because of age, wouldn't recommend for someone much younger. IUD's and other hormonal birth controls will be recommended by doc. Incision is very discrete. NB Dr McPherson - this doctor does not accept payment plans and needs payment in full before surgery can take place.

Also in Roswell and Suwanee. Doctor’s statement: “In light of recent events, & with the uncertainty of what’s to come, if you desire permanent sterilization surgery (removing your tubes) I am happy to provide this service.” Also in Suwanee and Roswell.

Dr. Jill Cierny with Northside Northpoint OBGYN. I (28 childfree and single) asked for sterilization and she scheduled my surgery that day after just a few questions about why I want it. I got a tubal ligation where she completely removed my tubes a few days ago. She actually listens to her patients and makes regular gyno checkups as quick and comfortable as possible. She told me she's had a lot of women request sterilization after the roe v Wade leak, and now that it's overturned I'm sure she will be working on sterilizing even more.

Dr. Amy Ottensmeyer performed bilateral salpingectomy for 25yo CF.  She is with Piedmont Women's Healthcare. She was hesitant but asked if I was 100% sure and ultimately performed the procedure for me during a diagnostic laparoscopy for potential ectopic pregnancy. Could be a good resource for other women seeking sterilization.

+1 Dr Rondon, Dr. Leah Rondon at Emory Decatur Hospital in Atlanta, GA agreed to sterilization via bilateral salpingectomy for me (22F). She was very professional and we went through all birth control options to discuss pros/cons compared to sterilization - in a very informative way, not pushy or disapproving of a desire for permanent birth control. She will sterilize 21 years of age and up; she only performs bisalps (billed as tubal via salpingectomy, which is great for insurance coverage - mine covers it fully); and she will only agree if you're 100% sure you don't want to conceive (to confirm you've thought about it long-term; she did mention the possibility for IVF in the future). She had lots of helpful suggestions and options, including IUD placement during the surgery for double peace of mind and to prevent periods, which is helpful for patients who don't want to have an IUD inserted vaginally due to pain but want to stop taking the pill. She mentioned she doesn't do bisalps and ablations in the same surgery due to potential for PATSS.

+1 Dr Rondon, She agreed to perform a bisalp on me at age 21 on my very first visit. We had a ~45min conversation going over what I wanted, how firm I was in my decision, other contraceptive options, and what the surgery would entail. No bingos, no condescendation, extremely respectful of my wants, just wanted to make sure I fully understood the consequences, risks, and alternatives. Was extremely informative and generally awesome throughout whole process and surgery went great! Also is very LGBT friendly.

Dr. Sara Campbell, Emory. She was very professional and understanding and gave me zero bingos. She completed my bilateral salpingectomy today and everything went so well!

AnnaMaria Maples, MD Emory Complex Family Planning, I am a part of a whole family planning clinic dedicated to getting people the contraception they need, sterilization included.

He listened to all of my symptoms, validated my pain, he did not trivialize any of my problems, he never once even remotely implied it was in my head, he treated my suffering seriously as it should have been YEARS ago and was ready to help me put this behind me once and for all. On my surgery notes in the months prior to scheduling the date it had said "Possible hysterectomy or possible IUD" in the surgical receipt. When I arrived I planned on telling him firmly I wanted a hysterectomy as I cannot tolerate an IUD, I have really bad pelvic pain. But to my surprise I didn't need to ask. He asked me first, framing it as asking ME how conservative or aggressive I wanted my treatment to be. I affirmed I wanted a hysterectomy and he simply said "OK!" and wrote that down. There was no bingo, no questioning, just accepting my preferred treatment plan. Which, to my happiness, is Dr. Albee's (the now retired founder of the CEC) philosophy on hysterectomies -- giving the patient the power to decide. My surgery went extremely well and my recovery so far has been even better than when I got my appendix out. I have three extremely small incisions. He sure enough found endometriosis scattered around my pelvic area including notably an adhesion freezing up my bowels. And, the biggest validation of them all, my uterus showed distinct signs of having adenomyosis. He agreed, a good call to kick it out. He is expecting me to make a FULL 100% recovery of being pain free and I cannot wait! The biggest drawback: CEC is not in network with ANY insurance providers. Either you have to self-pay or you will be billed as an out of network. This makes the CEC very expensive. But I am glad I went.

[Dr. Cantey Dogan](http://www.piedmont-obgyn.com/). Bilateral Salpingectomy (58661 procedure code) for Sterilization (Z30.2 diagnostic code). I am 29. I have been married for over 5 years to a male partner. We have both been firmly child free for 8+ years, but she asked me zero questions on my husband’s opinion of the procedure. Her only interest in him was on whether he could drive me home, and whether I felt safe at home with him. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance and had my surgery pre-authorized as a sterilization, meaning it will be fully covered under ACA with no copay or deductible. My doctor only explained it was permanent, talked through facts on regret statistics, and confirmed I understood the risks and benefits as she had described them. On my very first visit with her, she approved me in less than 10 minutes. I am college educated with professional licensure in my field and brought a sterilization binder with me (I didn’t need it). I knew exactly what procedure I wanted and why, and I used the appropriate medical terminology to describe what I wanted done. I don’t know if any of that made a difference in her approval or not.

[Dr. Stephen Weiss](https://providers.emoryhealthcare.org/provider/Stephen+H+Weiss/780353). Approved me with absolutely no push back. Just the minimum questions that the ACOG recommends to make sure someone is fully informed of their options (eg making sure that you know it’s permanent and surgery risks, he might ask you about an IUD if you have not had one, which is an ACOG recommendation, but he will move on if you insist/have had an IUD already).

+1 Dr Weiss, partial hysterectomy. I am 27, unmarried, no children, assigned female at birth but identifty nonbinary. I was asked general questions about my family planning, we discussed a previous IUD that didnt work long term, and after he informed me that he had to confirm i was aware that the procedure would mean i would never be able to carry a pregnancy myself, he approved me for the surgery. there was no pushback or issues of any kind, he was polite and respectful of my choices throughout.

Dr Sara Jennings, bilateral salpingectomy for 35F

Dr. Jill Purdie @ Northside Women’s Specialists. I’m 36, no kids, never married. Zero questions after I told her I wasn’t interested in hormonal options or an iud. Wonderful to work with and extremely knowledgeable. Took about six week from consult to surgery.

[Dr. Sallie McSwain](https://doctors.piedmont.org/provider/Sallie+McLean+McSwain/1647098) in Atlanta Ga with Peachtree women’s specialist is my doctor. I am 22f and was approved for a tubal, just got it done yesterday!

[Dr Justin Watson](https://www.wellstar.org/physicians/justin-watson-md?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=google&utm_content=Justin_Michael_Watson). Asked just a few questions to make sure i knew the permanence of the procedure. No bingos and respected my views of being child free. Put in a request to schedule the surgery a month later. [Dr Murphy Townsend](https://www.wellstar.org/physicians/murphy-townsend-md?utm_medium=listing&utm_source=google&utm_content=Murphy_Furman_Townsend) performed the procedure while again, making sure i knew what the procedure entailed. I gave signed confirmation of understanding and the procedure was completed with no bingos. Both doctors were very polite and friendly making sure i was as comfortable as i can be and knew all the information possible.

**Augusta** 

[Dr. Rafael Jordan](https://www.augustaobgynspecialists.com/) - Augusta OBGYN Specialists, Augusta, Georgia. 23/F/tubal ligation (cauterisation). 
He was very impressed and very professional. The only thing he brought up was possible regret, and when I showed him a study that disproved it in my sterilization binder, he immediately said yes. My surgery was set to be a month away. No bingos, no need to convince him.

[Dr. Carla Morgan-Gibbs](https://obgynaugusta.com/about-us/) preformed my (F32) bisalp 12/20/2022. No bingos - she was totally supportive. Now, I have been seeing her for several years, and she has known about my stance on having children so that may have had something to do with. However, she did a wonderful job with my surgery and she has always been very polite and kind.

+1 Dr. Morgan-Gibbs. Jan 2023. Bisalp on 29-year-old redditor. I've never had such a positive gyn appointment - absolutely everyone was respectful, professional, and kind. I had my annual exam at the same time (had been neglecting since the move), and have never had such a pain free experience. She asked my reasons for sterilization (not wanting kids, not wanting to be on hormonal BC, wanting something more permanent that an IUD) and didn't push.

Performed bilateral salpingectomy and was willing to perform ablation for 30-year-old unmarried woman. Made sure patient understood permanency but didn't force his opinions. Very understanding. 

**Columbus**

[Dr Monica Fortson, OBGYN]( https://doctors.piedmont.org/provider/Monica+Hokanson+Fortson/790845) 1538 13th Avenue, Suite C200, Columbus, GA 31901, 706-320-2547. Bisalp done on 23-year-old redditor. "No pushback, and I’m trans, which she was very cool about, never misgendered me and only referred to me with my chosen name and pronouns. She was very respectful of it being my body and my choice."

[Susan Westerlund](https://www.healthgrades.com/group-directory/ga-georgia/columbus/susan-westerlund-gynecology-oy4kd2y), who approved surgery and recommended a surgeon, and [Dr. Richard Stevens](https://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Richard_Stephens.html). Procedure was a bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy. I am 25, single, no children. They were amazing. The most caution I received was the responsible and medically necessary amount, to ensure I understood the procedure and the implications. They are caring, respectful healthcare professionals, and, especially at 25, unmarried with no kids, I was incredibly thankful at how easy they made the experience for me. Overall I paid about $350 in total for all physician and hospital costs. Insurance was a tricky process though and I'm still waiting to see if I might get refunded more. (Insurance was Anthem BCBS.)

[Amy Rodatus, MD](https://www.goodobgyn.com/dr-amy-rodatus.php). This gynecologist has contacted us directly to advise, "I am a gynecologist in Georgia and have always provided sterilization to any woman interested regardless of age and prior child bearing status."

+1 Dr Rodatus, 29 y/o Black female. Never had children. Approved for a bilateral salpingectomy. She never bingoed me. Explained to me all my birth control options and, of course, the risk of a bilateral salpingectomy. Dr. Rodatus and her clinical team were very professional and made me feel comfortable. No one on her clinical team bingoed me as wel. Highly recommend for any women residing in the Metro Atlanta area!

+1 Dr Rodatus, she performed a Bilateral Laparoscopic Salpingectomy on a unmarried, childless, 20 y/o female with no prior doctor-patient relationship. No bingos from her or any of the staff, no arguments/explanations required to approve procedure. Relayed required medical information (risks, side effects, etc), possible alternatives, and procedure information. Very professional and very understanding.

[Doctor Graysan Kirk Southern, MD](https://providers.emoryhealthcare.org/provider/Graysan+Kirk+Southern/778196). Bilateral salpingectomy. I am a 35F, never married, and no children. I was originally seeking a partial hysterectomy (my old gynecologist was not covered for surgery under my insurance), and I said so immediately at my first visit with him. His only reaction was to ask if I had done my research for the potential side effects from major abdominal surgery. He never asked whether I was married or had kids or if I was sure I wanted it. He also never tried to talk me out of it even a little. The only reason we ended up going with removing my tubes was that, you guessed it, that surgery was mostly covered by my insurance but a hysterectomy wasn't (without going through more hoops than I had the patience or money for.) He was nothing but kind and patient with me from beginning to end, and he genuinely seemed to care about me and my well being. He also had some very choice things to say about the medical field being cruel to women in general and specifically their choices regarding their own bodies. He is LGBTQIA+ as well.

~Please not that this doctor will only be available for military personnel and their dependents as he practices on an Army post.~ [Dr. Jeffries, an OB/GYN in Fort Gordon, GA, specializes in the field of women's health, treating conditions that affect the female reproductive system.](https://www.md.com/doctor/martin-jeffries-md#reviews) Dr. Jeffries was the third doctor I saw at this office and at our first appointment we discussed birth control options. After I went over each non permanent option and why it wasn't a good fit for me he was happy to agree to perform a bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation on a childfree 22 year old married active duty service member with no push back. he was quick to schedule the appointment and the surgery went off without a hitch. He is also open to other options such as tuball ligation, partial hysterectomy, etc. 

Dr. George Cabe Address: 220 Jl White Dr Ste 120, Jasper, GA 30143 Phone: (706) 229-2250. I am 30, married, childfree. The first thing this doctor said to me is "this is your body and your choice". I asked for a tubal and he explained that a bisalp would be better since it reduces risk of cancer and is least painful. He talked me through the three options for tubals, including the bisalp. He didn't ask me about my husband, or why I wanted this. He was amazing and the opposite of the horror stories I read here. He then told me I should also consider a hydrothermal ablation to reduce periods since I was certain I never wanted children. I saw him for the first time in May (first and only appointment) and my surgery is scheduled for July 18th. Highly recommend him.

I'm 23 and she approved the procedure the day I met her. She's through Kaiser insurance, but she works through one of the hospitals in atlanta. She was super friendly both times I've seen her so far.

When asked if this doctor would be open to sterilising younger people the doctor responded, "Every patient is different. I meet with everyone first to discuss what has lead them to the decision to be sterilized to make sure there's not an alternative option, since regret is the number one side effect documented in younger women." Use with caution if under 30.

Dr. Christopher Keith provided my husband with a vasectomy and only asked if he/we were sure and gave us/him no problems with not already having children. He also put him under general anesthesia due to a history of PTSD.

**Piedmont** 

Dr Dalal Eldick,  I originally went to her for my yearly, and in the paperwork, it asks if there are any other things you’d like to discuss with your doctor. I wrote “tubes tied” and once in the office she was warm, friendly, and nonjudgmental. She doesn’t judge you on alternative relationship dynamics, amount of partners, or anything like that. She is kind, and her body language follows her kind words. I brought up tubes tied and she asked me if I want the tubes taken out, I said yes. I had an appointment for preop after that one visit. No bingoes, no dissuasion, no judgment. Never once asked me about what my husband wants, and didn’t play into any of the usual guilt. Amazing doctor.

Had NO prior doctor-patient relationship, my very first visit I asked to be sterilized and he has no issues doing it. Did not require a pap smear or anything else. Very kind and understanding. 

+1 I had my tubes cauterized today by Dr. Steven Bradshaw located at 330 Turner McCall Blvd, Ste 203 Rome, GA 30165. Phone: 706-235-6539.  Everyone from the nurses to the aesthetician and, of course, Dr. Bradshaw was great. The anesthesiology nurse did borderline bingo, but I was not uncomfortable. She took my answer and didn’t press after that. The office manger with Dr. Bradshaw, Tanya, was great, and no one questioned me about my decision. I had never seen Dr. Bradshaw before, but asked for a tubal ligation. We chatted for a bit about it and he said, “you’re an adult, who am to tell you no? You’ve thought about it, and I’m fine to do it.” I am a 28F, no kids, no pregnancies, no desire for kids.

+1 Dr. Bradshaw. March 2023. Procedure: Bilateral Salpingectomy. Everyone involved was great; from consultation appointment (no prior doc/patient relationship and that was no problem) to the post-op appointment. The entire thing transpired within 3 or so months and the healing process was a breeze. +1 for office manager Tanya too! She was very helpful. 5/5, would recommend. I feel like I've truly honored myself with this decision/action.

[Dr. Andrew Michigan](https://www.urologysavannah.com/about-us). There was an initial consultation on July 14th so right at 30 days from then and the actual surgery. He asked me how many kids I had and I said 0. He then asked if we (my wife and I) wanted to keep our life quiet and I said yes. No further questions were asked on why I wanted the procedure. He also gave me the option of general anesthesia or a local anesthetic. I chose the local option. I am 29 years old and my wife and I do not want to have children. The surgery was held at his office on the surgery floor and everyone was super nice. I was given an injection of midazolam to help me relax. The procedure was super quick. I was given a prescription for oxycodone but haven't needed it as there has been little pain during my recovery. I've only used ibuprofen.

[Dr. Bradley Newtown in Saint Mary's GA.](https://www.sghs.org/Find-a-Provider/N/Bradley-William-Newton-M-D-.aspx). He preformed my sterilization in June, I am 22F with no kids. He listened to me well and did try to offer non surgical options for birth control but it never felt condescending it truly felt like he just wanted to offer non surgical options as surgery is a bit invasive. I did use the sterilization binder to use as a boost but he only looked at one of the articles, asked if i was sure, and said yes. He was very understanding and said that he understood I was an adult and knew what I wanted. 10/10 would recommend him to anyone in the southeast GA/ North FL region. They accept a pretty diverse range of insurances as well.

770-474-5281, Vasectomy. I'm 30 and my wife is 27. The consultation was almost confusingly brief. He asked if I was sure I didn't want kids and if I was sure my wife didn't want kids. (I would describe her thoughts on having kids as "militantly opposed.") He didn't ask to speak with her and went straight into explaining the procedure, which took about five minutes. Within ten minutes of going into the exam room I was scheduling the procedure for two weeks from the initial visit. This doctor went to Yale undergrad and Harvard for med school, so I'm not worried about his qualifications. I'm having the procedure done next week, so I can report how the procedure and recovery went soon.

**Warner Robins**

[Sarah Stanescu](https://pfwobgyn.com/)  at Physicians for Women 1021 North Houston Road, Warner Robins, Georgia, 31093  (478) 922-9944. I'm 24F (no children) and recieved a bilateral salpingectomy 2 weeks ago. I saw Sarah Stanescu as a new patient and left with my surgery scheduled. No bingos, no talking me out of it. I did share that I had a long term partner that was also CF, but she didn't push for that. We talked about my own mental health and chronic illness struggles as well as my long family history of schizophrenia/bipolar disorder, etc as a part of her "new patient" work up. Then I brought up my desire to have a bilateral salpingectomy and she said "yeah we can do that if you'd like to. It's understandable why you'd want you. You're a grown woman and you're at an age where you should be able to make decisions about your body." I burst into happy tears. I had to have a pre-op appointment at the hospital and sign a few papers saying that I knew what I was getting myself into. I saw her the first time in March and had my surgery schedule for April.

**Woodstock** 

[Bobby Tackett](https://www.obgynassociatesmarietta.com/?utm_source=gmb_auth) has been my ob since I was 15, he has advocated for my independence in my choices since my first appointment with him. When I was 16, my mom was against me getting an iud. After a bit of bickering he got her to leave the room and continued the process to get me an iud because he believed that it was my choice and no one else’s. I’m currently 19 and had a gyno appointment yesterday. After a quick conversation about me not wanting to have kids in the future (which I had been mentioning to him during every check up since I was 15), he immediately gave me a ton of options for sterilization! He said that I’m young and it wouldn’t be ideal for me to get a hysterectomy for hormonal reasons(I completely agree) but he said if I wanted one that it’s my body and my decision. He also said he stands by the fact that “old rules” for sterilization are just that. Old. He doesn’t care about marital status, or how many kids you have. Just about what you think is best for yourself. We decided on clipping my tubes, but I said that I wanted to wait until my iud is ready to be taken out, to which he agreed. So now I have a year left until I’m completely child free!
