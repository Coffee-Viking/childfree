###HAWAII

**Honolulu**

[Dr. Karin M. Hayashida, MD, OBGYN](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/hawaii/provider/karin-hayashida-9277079) Kaiser Permanente Honolulu Medical Office. 1010 Pensacola St , Honolulu , HI 96814, 808-432-2000. Relocated from Seattle, WA. 

[Dr. Tim Roytman](https://www.alohaurology.com/meet-our-doctors) gave me a no-scalpel vasectomy something like 6 years ago around 23 years old with a comment something along the lines of "I look at it like getting a tattoo - they're both viewed as permanent, and you have the right to do to what you want to your body." No bingos, just business. Insurance covered it, and I don't believe I had any copay at the office. Outpatient at the clinic, in and out. Super easy. He was also supportive, because he told me he had also gotten a vasectomy two weeks prior to doing mine, and we had a laugh at the smell the cauterization of the vas deferens made. "Going to your own bbq", lol. I don't live in Hawaii anymore, but hopefully that helps others. I've got no reason to believe his views have changed, but I realize that it was a long time ago.

[Dr. Greg LaNouette](http://www.alohaurology.com) (Vasectomy) "We're not in the business of telling people how to live their lives." NB Dr LaNouette does not appear on the Alona Urology website currently and we recommend phoning the clinic to confirm his current location. 

[Dr. Diana T. Kumar](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/hawaii/provider/diana-kumar-3310301) (Bilateral Salpingectomy) No bingos, very straight-foward and kind. Willing to sterilize 26 year old female with no children.

[Dr Aya Sultan at Honu Womens Health](https://honuwh.com/dr-aya-sultan/). I had a bilateral salpingectomy at 32F, not married, no kids. She is my regular gyno, mentioned thought of procedure at 28/29. She was receptive and said let me know when you’re ready. At my annual, I said I was ready, so we schedule a separate appt to discuss. 30 minutes of her having to tell me side effects and reiterate it’s permanent, she gave no push back on my reason. 2 months later we had surgery schedule, 2 weeks prior another 30 minute Appt to sign papers and answer my questions about the procedure from her prospective (vs online info). Day of ask 2 more times (prep room and right before going under) that I was sure (in a I have to do this legally way not in a way to talk me out of it). She’s helpful and direct; 10/10 recommend.

Teresa Walsh, MD. 1010 Pensacola St, Honolulu, HI 96814, United States. Phone: +1 808-432-2000. Kaiser insurance only. For sterilisation: 18yo or older, no marital limitations, may be able to complete treatment via a vaginal approach depending on the patient. Offers gender affirming treatment.

**Lihue** 

[Patrick Showalter](https://www.hawaiipacifichealth.org/find-a-physician/search-results/Patrick-Showalter/2722). Bilateral No-Scalpel Vasectomy with electro-cauterization. 25, Engaged, Childfree. Was a very smooth process from consultation to procedure. When I met with the doc he didn't question my choice at all, and focused on explaining the medical aspects. His only concern was to confirm that I had in fact talked about with my fiance about it. I was scheduled within the month, and the procedure took about 30min with minimal discomfort. I was able to drive myself home and return to regular activities a couple days later.

###IDAHO

**Boise**

[Dr. Dirk T. Carlson MD]( https://www.stlukesonline.org/health-services/providers/carlson-dirk) in St. Luke's OB/GYN: Boise, 100 E. Idaho St. Suite 302, Boise, ID, 83712, 208-343-7501. Medically necessary partial hysterectomy on 29-year-old redditor. Dr. Carlson saw the OR notes from my laparoscopy and was appalled I hadn't been approved for a partial hysterectomy. He said it was clear that it was medically necessary from all my symptoms and the notes in my chart, and that I was sound of mind and understood all the risks and that couldn't have kids after (don't want any anyways) and now two months later I've had it done. Don't give up, ladies. There are good doctors out there even in these turbulent times.

[Dr. Gary Gregerson. MD, OBGYN](https://nampaobgyn.com/) Advanced Specialty Care for Women.  N. Rosepoint Way #100, Boise, ID 83713, (208) 468-9400. Doctor has done bisalps on CF women without pushback.  Also in Nampa.

[Dr. Suzanne Rice](https://womenshealthboise.com/dr-suzanne-rice/) in Boise, Idaho removed my fallopian tubes. My entire experience with her was absolutely incredible. I am 33, childless, and unmarried. She never once questioned my decision, nor did she ask about my current dating relationship or what my partner thought. She centered my needs the entire time. While she did remind me 2x that the surgery is permanent, it was verbalized in a very unbiased, informative way. The nurses were also consistent in this. They all were super helpful and all happy to help me, even excited. I had my consult and surgery all within 5 weeks! Surgery also went very well and Dr. Rice prepared me for what to expect - no surprises so far. The cost of the procedure wasn't much - $350 with my insurance. The bigger expense is the anesthesia and the fact the procedure had to be done at St. Luke's hospital surgery center (those details are still being worked out but with my high deductible plan will probably run me close to 7k). OP has updated us to advise their total out-of-pocket was $300.

**Meridian** 

[Dr. Rebecca Uranga, MD.](https://ogaidaho.com/providers/about-dr-becky-uranga/) - I (a married, very childfree, 28yo female) was treated like a human being with bodily autonomy in a state (Idaho, USA) that I never expected I would! A few years ago, when I was 28yo, I went in for a consultation with Dr. Uranga even though she wasn't my GYN. I am married to my husband who is also very childfree and no human children exist from either of us! My primary care physician recommended Dr. Uranga, as she went to school with her and held her in high regard. Dr. Uranga asked the standard questions such as: am I aware that this is permanent, do you already have children, does your husband know (I got more of a she was concerned for my safety vibe, versus a does my husband approve vibe.) It almost seemed like she was going through the standard questions because she had to, not because she was questioning my decision. She ultimately said something along the lines of well you look like you've done your research, lets get you on the schedule. She also recommended doing the bilateral salpingectomy as opposed to the tubal, due to the possibility of ovarian cancer starting in the tubes. I scheduled my appointment for a few weeks later which took place at St. Luke's Hospital in Meridian, Idaho. I had an all female team, including my anesthesiologist and they were all supportive and kind. The procedure was done robotically and was less than 45 mins! She even showed me pics of my ovaries and uterus afterward, which I was thrilled to see!

[Jared G. Heiner, MD](http://tvurology.com/). I am 28, single, and have zero children. Dr. Heiner had me in and out in about 25 minutes. That was for both the consultation and the vasectomy, same day. During the whole process he asked me the normal questions but never tried to persuade me not to get it.

**Pocatello** 

[Dr Vanessa Cameron, DO FACOG,](https://www.facebook.com/pocatellowomenshealthclinic/) Pocatello Women's Health Clinic. This gynecologist has reached out directly to, "offer our surgical expertise to assist with your reproductive autonomy". 

[Peter J Jones, Urologist](https://portneufmedicalgroup.org/find-a-doctor/peter-j-jones-md), completed vasectomy. Dr. Jones and all the nurses at the Portneuf hospital outpatient urology clinic did a FANTASTIC job completing my husbands vasectomy. 25/26yrs old, married, no kids, no questions asked. I kept waiting for a bingo, but it never happened! I also want to add-we shopped around A LOT and Dr. Jones was least expensive by far. Our completely out of pocket cost was $605 total which is half of some other local clinic’s prices. He also did a great job maintaining professionalism but showing great bedside manner. He brought in a speaker and played some music while he was working and handled my husband passing out quite well.

[Dr. Michael Jones](https://pocatellowomensclinic.com/providers/michael-jones-do/) that approved and performed my Bilateral Salpingectomy. I'm 33 with 0 children. He only asked me if I had any kids and left it at that, stating he believed it was my choice and no one else's. He approved me right then and there and my insurance covered everything.

Dr. Bergsten of Womens Health Clinic in Pocatello. I was already sterilized when I saw Dr. Bergsten, but he said he would be willing to do a bisalp on anyone over 21 as long as they understand the “risk of regret,” but ultimately it’s up to the patient. He said commercial insurance will likely cover it but Idaho Medicaid likely will not cover it. NOTE: this doctor has not yet been verified to sterilise.

Bilateral salpingectomy, 25F, single, no kids and never had/having any. Very pleasant experience on my first day meeting her. Listened and understood why I'm not having kids and worries, and reassured me she will do the procedure if I'm 100% sure of my choice. She never bingo'd me; just ask the standard questions before approval. Before procedure, she ask again if I'm 100% sure (not a bingo, just making sure I didn't change my mind when in a hospital setting), and did it. Her nurses never bingo'd me either. All were lovely. Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance.

+1 Dr King, bilateral salpingectomy 23F. 

+1 Dr King, 23, Female, Single/Never Married. Never been pregnant, desire to remain childfree. Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy (removal of both Fallopian tubes) Dr.King was my first choice from the subreddit list. She listened to my story, then told me, “legally, I have to forewarn you this procedure is permanent birth control. But you seem very aware of your choice. If you want to proceed I would be delighted to help you.” Within a week, I scheduled my procedure. 3 months later, I had the surgery. I am 36 hours post-op and feel well enough to go to work Monday. I was given better care than I could’ve hoped for, was never told to rethink my choice and no bingos from anyone on her staff.

+1 Dr. King, Feb 2023. Bisalp on 33-year old redditor.

[Dr Alex Argyelan](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/19159/alex-argyelan-obstetrics__gynecology-aurora-oswego) - no bingos, all professional, their office displays LGBT+ and ally support messages, and the whole process only took a month from pre to post-op. Most major insurances accepted (listed on that link).  I'm 27, have a trans partner, am childfree, and had a fantastic bilateral salpingectomy experience from this doctor.

No bingos, although he did go over alternative options (so if you consider that a bingo then just one). Insurance covered most of it.

-1 Dr McCool 26F- promised we could talk about permanent methods of birth control if an IUD didn't work well. He did agree to place the IUD under anesthesia. The IUD fell out after 3 months and he refused to consider permanent options as I am "too young" and there are "risks involved"

**Arlington Heights and  Buffalo Grove**

[Dr. Elyse P. Erlich](https://www.womancarepc.com/contact-us) - bilateral salpingectomy. If you are serious about getting sterilized, she will believe you and not patronize you, but does make sure you understand any risks and understand it's permanent, etc.

+1 Dr. Elyse Erlich, Arlington Heights, IL. I’m a 29 year old woman. No bingos at the consult, very supportive. Never once asked what my spouse thought about it, only asked if I always knew I didnt want kids. Super flexible scheduling and called before and after the procedure. Even pointed out that the care team I had was “an all woman team, we’ve got this” as I went in the OR. Wonderful experience overall

-1 for Dr. Elyse P. Erlich in Arlington Heights, IL: Single 22 y/o asking for a bisalp. Said she was uncomfortable doing it on someone my age and the only way she would consider it was if I had my parents come in with me or if I got a letter from a therapist/psychiatrist okaying it. Plenty of bingos. Also uneducated about trans/enby matters at least, transphobic at worst.

**Canton** 

[Sam Rickerl](https://www.sharecare.com/doctor/dr-samuel-j-rickerl) - Performed Essure and Thermal Ablation on a 21 year old with no children. Didn't bingo or give any push back. Just asked why and explained the procedure. Unsure if he offers other methods of Tubal Ligation, and if so i'm unsure of which other options. He's also on facebook under, "Samuel J Rickerly, MD, Obsterics and Gynecology".

**Carbondale**

[Dr. Andre Bobo, M.D.] (http://newhorizonsobgyn.net/) Dr. Bobo, was very kind and only asked medical history questions, no bingos.

[Dr. Douglas Gates](https://www.newhorizonsobgyn.net/) I (21f) went in for a consultation to be sterilized. We had discussed the different forms of procedures that had been done and choose a bilateral tubal. Dr gates never bingo'd however he did ask how my fiance felt about the situation and asked about 4-5 if I was absolutely sure. I was scheduled the the month.

**Champaign/Urbana**

[Dr. Sarah Young](http://www.christieclinic.com/provider/sarah-young/), Tubal Ligation

[Dr. Tamara Helfer](https://www.christieclinic.com/providers/511/Tamara-Helfer-MD/provider) I haven't been bingoed at all, just confirmed that I realized this is a permanent sterilization. She said absolute lowest age for sterilization for her is 21, thought she mentioned that women age 35 and over have the least amount of regret. So she said if someone is absolutely adamant and doesn't want an IUD she'd just chart that, make sure patient is well aware this is permanent, and do sterilization.

-1 Dr Helfer: 23, unmarried I requested a consultation for sterilization, specifically a bisalp. She said she doesn't see a lot of 23 year olds asking for sterilization, and she wouldn't want to do something permanent on when there are "so many other options" available, that she wouldn't want me to "meet someone and decide I did want to have children," and that "half of women who get sterilized before 35 regret it." I left with a pamphlet on IUDs and other long term birth controls.

[Dr. Elsa Jane Whitmore](https://carle.org/Find-a-Doctor/2628) - Bilateral salpingectomy. I, single 28F who had already had an IUD that I didn't want to replace and made clear that didn't ever want children, was offered a bilateral salpingectomy. No bingoes at all. She said she could tell I was serious. Shared that she'd recently performed a BS on a childfree 23 year old too. Surgery was scheduled promptly a month after I signed consents and the surgery went great. No comments or bingoes from anyone involved in my care. A great, smooth, respectful experience.

+1 Dr Whitmore, Bilateral salpingectomy (completed), 27, single. I saw an NP at Carle for my annual and pushed for a consult w/ a surgeon. Once it was in my file that I asked for a consult, I called Dr. Whitmore's office to book an appointment with her specifically. The nurse that saw me at Dr. Whitmore’s office asked if I was there to discuss sterilization or to set an appointment for it and I said the latter. Zero bingoes, immediately got down to the planning.

+1 Dr Whitmore, I’m 25F, unmarried, no kids. She didn’t stonewall me during the consult and we signed the paperwork at the end of the meeting. I was in for surgery three months later and all went well. She and her nurses were very respectful and supportive. The day I went in for surgery she also said she was performing multiple of the same procedure.

**Chicago**

[Adrienne Adams, MD, FACOG (OBGYN)](www.womenobgyn.net) The Women’s Group of Northwestern Chicago, IL and Northbrook, IL 312-440-3810. This gynecologist has contacted us directly to be added to the list. 

+1 Dr Adams, I found her from this thread and she told me I was her first patient from reddit! I just wanted to update and say she was AMAZING. I am 30 childfree and single. None of that mattered- she said "You are a first time patient and you found me on reddit so I am assuming you have been on this journey for a while and are sure." She went over all my questions and answered them from a medical standpoint (I have underlying issues) We decided to go with removing the tubes, once I have the insurance information set on my end we will be setting a date for the surgery.

[Dr. Tamika Alexander](https://hospital.uillinois.edu/find-a-doctor/tamika-alexander), UIC; I sent her an email through the patient portal before my appointment explaining that I wanted a salpingectomy (since I was 12) and why, and indicated that I understood it was a permanent procedure, I know LARCs exist, and I still prefer permanent and irreversible contraception. I had brought [the 'new' ethics guidelines](https://www.acog.org/-/media/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/co695.pdf) with me to my appointment but didn't need to make my case any further after sending that message. 

Dr. Michelle Beck in Chicago at Swedish/Northshore. No bingos and was very easy to work with! 23F, bilateral salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Jonas Benson UroPartners](https://uropartners.com/physicians/Jonas%20Benson Western suburbs of Chicago). During my initial consult, other asking the standard verification questions about proceeding with the procedure itself, there was no judgement or any other discrimination toward me being child-free.

[Dr. Monica Christmas](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/monica-christmas) - did a salpingectomy and endometrial ablation for me. I was 30. Didn't have to explain anything to her and she straight up said "I don't think everyone has to be a mom" and that was end of discussion. Insurance covered 100%. She is at University of Chicago. Amazing doc.

[Dr. Leah Delfinado](http://doctors.advocatehealth.com/a/leah-delfinado-chicago-obstetrics-gynecology), Advocate Medical Group; Essure / Tubal Ligation

[Dr. Sarah Faris](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/sarah-faris) Vasectomy for a 30M with no kids, was asked "are you sure you don't want kids", to which i answered an emphatic yes and was scheduled for my procedure.  In and out in 30 minutes, fantastic experience

[Charles T Hughes MD](https://uropartners.com/physicians/Charles%20T%20%20hughes) 24M vasectomy. He never bingo'd me and even said he does not have problems doing it on anyone as long as they understand the procedure. 

[Jessica W Kiley MD Northwestern Memorial](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1306018742/jessica-w-kiley-md) (accepted my Aetna insurance). Super nice. Some concern if under 30, asked for one month wait before scheduling procedure but respected my decision and assured me that no bingos will happen. Offered salpingectomy. NB Dr Kiley isn't currently taking new patients and it is unclear when she will resume doing so. 
[Dr. Maria Teresa Tam](http://allforwomenhealthcare.com), Essure / Bilateral salpingectomy (does not offer any other kind of tubal, only salpingectomy) - shows some concern if you're under 30 (I was 24), but no bingo-ing and just wants to make sure you understand the risk of regret and procedure risks before moving ahead
[Leanne R. McCloskey, MD](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1700115029/leanne-r-mccloskey-md) - Procedure: Tubal ligation My info: 30, single (do not currently have a partner), no kids Optional: I have Aetna Premier Care Network (APCN) covered majority of my procedure. I think I had a remaining $300-$500 I had to cover myself, but Northwestern lets you pay it off in increments over two years without interest. I met with my doctor for the first time on January 28 and had my procedure done on March 1. No bingos!

Dr. Scott Moses, UChicago Medicine. Dr. Moses did my (27F, no kids) bilateral salpingectomy. He did make me wait 30 days to schedule the surgery, but he went above & beyond with my concerns regarding pain management and cost. He is now my regular obgyn.

[Dr. Rebekah Osgood, Chicago, Illinois](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1013146596/rebekah-e-osgood-md). Performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on a single childfree 28 year old woman with no pushback. Was extremely affable and validating throughout the whole process--made it clear she performs these procedures every week and wanted me to have as easy a time as possible. I ultimately paid $20 out of pocket (I am on a Blue Cross PPO) and was delighted with the ease of my recovery.

676 N Saint Clair St, Suite 1880 Chicago, IL 60611; 312 642 9844 (front desk is not competent, so be on top of checking for accurate appointment info)
Respectful of patient wishes and bodily autonomy! But go in prepared with having a firm stance on never wanting kids, and not wanting to try any other BC methods to prevent pregnancy. She immediately offered Bilateral Salpingectomy instead of a Tubal. This will get billed as BS, and not Sterilization so just a fair warning to you about that. I was approved at 31 years old but I think I could have been sooner. She is a very responsive doctor to any questions you have.
[Dr. Elizabeth Yepez, MD](http://www.dryepez.com/) Rush University OB/GYN Consultant (accepted my BCBS insurance)
Very professional and respectful of my(30F) choice to get a Bilateral Salpingectomy. Was willing to schedule my surgery as soon as I was willing and able to take time off of work, and did not have a "waiting period" as some doctors do. She asked me standard questions to make sure that I knew what I was asking for, but did not try to dissuade me. The entire staff, from the doctor's office to the surgical team, were friendly, polite, and respectful.

[Dr. David Shore](https://uropartners.com/physicians/David%20M%20Shore), Vasectomy. Four months past my procedure, I'm very happy with how it all went. Well-run practice and very personable doctor.

[Dr. Julia Simon, UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/julia-simon) - Bilateral Salpingectomy. I'm 29 and engaged. Dr. Simon is my regular gyno, and she's been great at all of my appointments, sterilization included. I brought up sterilization at an annual physical, and she talked through potential options. Her only pushback was to ask whether I had considered asking my fiancé to have a vasectomy, but only because that was less invasive than a salpingectomy. She did list regret with other potential side effects, but she was clear that she thought it was my decision. OOP cost was $10 for post-op pain meds, nothing for the surgery itself or my two week post-op follow up appt (BCBSIL PPO+).

[Dr. Susan Tsai](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1962459776/susan-c-tsai-md), Northwestern Medical in Chicago. performed bilateral salping-oophorectomy on a childless 20-something. did not ask any weird questions about future children or pressure me into changing my mind. took health and desires seriously and scheduled procedure out only 1 month from initial consult. a very skilled surgeon and good bedside manner, also good with transgender patients if this is relevant to you. Works on complex gynecology cases so can do more "intense" sterilization procedures like hysto and oophorectomy. can perform laparoscopic surgery for minimal scarring. 

+1 Dr. Tsai. Bisalp on 25-year-old redditor.  No bingos whatsoever, she literally approved my request within 5 minutes of me bringing it up. Very skillful surgeon as well. I thanked her for taking me seriously and she said that they always try to make sure people know what they are getting themselves into, but if the patient seems informed and determined then it's not their place to interfere with the decisions.

Dr. Madeline Stark at Rush did my bilateral salpingectomy earlier this month. I'm childfree and she was very supportive and affirming of my decision. She also has a great bedside manner and took time to answer all my questions.

**Downers Grove**

Willing to perform tubal ligation before you're 30. Hesitant if you're younger than early 20s, but willing to discuss the procedure as a future option. Very easy to talk to and very informative.

+1 Dr Patsavas. Tubal ligation on 31F, married, no kids, asked for a laparoscopic tubal ligation, and Dr. Patsavas asked 0 questions. Just confirmed that I understood the procedure was permanent.She actually recommended a bilateral salpingectomy to further reduce risk of pregnancy, but my insurance wouldn't cover it. 2 cm on each side is standard, but she did 3-4 cm on each side. I couldn't be happier with my experience with her =). Dr. Patsavas is a trauma-informed gynecologist.

Dr Jennifer Dust, 29F bilateral salpingectomy, I also don't need my boyfriends "permission" or anything. She treated me like I was a grown woman capable of making my own choices.

[Dr. Shawn Davies](https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/shawn-davies-md-309876#about), tubal ligation. 28F CF. He asked me about my typical medical history, and then asked why I wanted the procedure. I was prepared for a bingo here, so I gave him my steadfast reasoning.

**Highland Park** 

Dr. Ryan S Kooperman in Illinois. I’m 21 and child free. He never once asked me about my relationship status or made me jump through any hoops! He asked me to wait 3 months before the operation itself happened (which is more than 100% reasonable in my opinion). The kindest, most thoughtful doctor I’ve ever had. He respected my autonomy more than any other physician I’ve ever encountered, and provides and example for every provider.

**Huntley** 

[Marianne C Krupka, DO.](https://www.nm.org/doctors/1215382999/marianne-krupka-do) She practices in northeastern Illinois. My friend (age 22) and I (age 33) each have no children of any kind and she was 100% supportive of sterilizing us with no questioning and no wait times (other than scheduling availability). The nurse simply confirmed if I am aware that I will never be able to have bio children, to which I said "YES! That's the point!" and that was all it took. The laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy procedures took place in the last half of 2022, and we are both very happy, healed well, no complications.

**Libertyville**

[Dr. Eileen Morrison](https://obgynedocs.com/). I had a bi salp from her at age 25 as a childfree woman. I am engaged, but no partner permission was needed. She agreed when I first asked with no questions asked. No bingos, and I've heard of her sterilizing as young as 23, but I'm guessing she would do it to anyone 21+

Dr. Jennifer Schaeffer of Ob Gyne associates in Libertyville, IL to the doctor list. She did my initial consult for my bisalp in early June and I was able to get in for surgery the first week of August. No bingos whatsoever and she was super understanding. I'm 30, not married. Didn't even ask about a partner. Dr. Morrison at the same clinic has also done bisalps as young as 23.

Michel K Borders M.D. with Silver Cross. 250 E Maple St, New Lenox, IL 60451. Endometrial ablation and tubal ligation - I was 24, no kids, not married. However I do have PCOS and Endometriosis, but he didn't really bring attention to that until after the procedure. He DID ask if I was married or had children, but when told no for both he asked if this was something I've been thinking about for a while. He didn't try to change my mind, we set up another appointment and when I showed up we talked for maybe 2 minutes, he said "looks like you've got your mind set, lets get you in ASAP".

Dr. Melissa Beally PCC Dr Tong health center located in the West Suburban hospital. 1 Eerie St Oak Park Illinois 60302. (708) 386-1301.

[Dr. Meredith Brawley](https://www.swedishamerican.org/provider/brawley-meredith). Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on 32 year old with no children (married, but she never even asked). Absolutely no bingos and was appalled I had been turned down previously. Went over the procedure with me thoroughly, including any potential risks and complications. Made sure I understood that the procedure is 100% permanent, effective immediately, and that IVF would be required should I desire pregnancy at any point in the future. She said that as long as she knew I fully understood those things, she had no problem performing the procedure.

+1 Dr. Meredith Brawley, laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (tubal ligation). 25, never married (wasn’t asked), and childfree (also wasn’t asked about this). Dr. Brawley was super nice and supportive throughout the whole process, and never once pushed back against my desire to be sterilised. I am trans (NB), which she was aware of, but my gender identity seemed largely irrelevant to her in supporting my decision. She very clearly explained the risks associated with the procedure and the only mention of children was to say that if I ever did want to get pregnant in the future, it would have to be IVF. She assured me that as long as I understood the risks, she was completely comfortable operating on me.

I was just approved for tubal ligation and ablation. He was so easy going. Made it clear I should of never had to fight or wait to have this done. Stated that he would of done it at age 21 had I seen him. Not now at 37. I've tried for 12 years. His colleges are list on the list but not taking new patients.

My surgery was done laparoscopically.

+1 Dr Lenox, He works at Lenox Healthcare for Women in Rockford, IL. I'm 28 years old. Never been married. No kids. Currently single. I went in for a consultation in December 2022.

He is a truly awesome and caring doctor!

When I mentioned that I was expecting to have to fight to get the procedure he said something along the lines of “You’re an adult, you’re more than capable of making your own decisions. I’m just here to explain your options and the risks and benefits of each”.

**Skokie** 

Dr. Cheryl Axelrod - she simply said "No babies for you? Cool, when do you wanna schedule the surgery". It's been 6 years since my surgery, and I'm still with the same partner and am still very much childfree.

+1 Dr Axelrod, she did my bisalp (25F) with no bingos. Just made sure I knew it was permanent and that there were other birth control options. She didn’t ask about my relationship status or what I would do if I met someone who wanted kids. She walked into the room and said “tell me your story, how did you end up here today asking for this.” She was super respectful and never made me feel questioned. Had my consult at the end of July and surgery 6 weeks later bc she is very busy. She did push back against an ablation, but said it was because I was young and they can sometimes be unsuccessful. She said she would do it if I really wanted, but didn’t recommend it. I ended up taking her advice as I feel like it came from a medical standpoint not moral

Scheduled my hysterectomy and bisalp (laparoscopic, since I’m nulliparous I’m not a candidate for vaginal). Accepts BCBS. She did ask a few questions relevant to my decision but she was not negative or resistant at all. She said she was just surprised that I knew exactly what I was asking for and that I was firm on it. She did say that a younger person might get a few more questions but that she would always respect bodily autonomy and wouldn’t deny anyone who was sure of their choice.

Bisalp and hysterectomy on 35-year-old redditer. A few years ago we discussed sterilization (she was all for doing it) but I ultimately opted for another IUD because bilateral salpingectomy wouldn't help my terrible periods. This year I decided I wanted the bilateral salpingectomy even if it meant keeping my IUD. During consult I asked if I could just get a hysterectomy and she was all for it. No bingoing, no asking what my husband thought. Due diligence to make sure I understand the procedure only, no judgement. Procedure itself done completely through vagina, no abdominal incisions. Best gyn I have ever had.

[Sallie S.Hahn, MD](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/sallie-s-hahn-md-6474) - almost exclusively performing bilateral salpingectomies these days as a more advanced procedure than clamps or clips. I had my consult yesterday and have not had an opportunity to schedule yet, but she is also okay with keeping hormonal IUD after the procedure, and I experienced zero bingos. For patients who have medicaid/medicare, there is a required consent form, due to issues in the past with forced sterilization. 34F

**Bloomington**

Dr Wendy Kinsey Corning, she tied my tubes at the age of 26, no questions asked. She then did my hysterectomy at age 28, after my employment.

[Dr. Tashera Perry](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/tashera-e-perry-md-8678). She is LGBTQ+ affirming, and will happily sterilize a young childless woman like myself. She is also a woman of color if that is helpful for some folks. She did not bingo me or grill me about my choice, she only made sure I understand the procedure and answered all my questions kindly and clearly. 

[Dr. Ashley Shumate](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/ashley-m-shumate-md-688281) at the age of 25, while single and completely childfree. She was very polite, explained that the procedure was permanent, but didn't pressure me into changing my mind nor question my choice. I did need to schedule the actual surgery at least one month in advance, which was explained as a general hospital policy.

I waited about 2.5 months for my initial appointment to meet her. She explained the procedure is permanent and ensure I understood risks and benefits, asked three times that I was sure this is what I wanted and said okay let’s do it at the end of the conversation. She never asked about my marital status. Waited 3 months for surgery as she only has one surgery day a month and my schedule didn’t line up with her sooner available surgery dates. She was fabulous, highly recommend.

This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I accept all insurances and will sterilize anyone 21, I take care of LGBTQ, will never require anything other than a woman's desire to be child free". Doctor is body-positive and sterilized a 280 lb woman without pushback or body-shaming.

+1 to Dr Courtney Browne in Carmel, Indiana. I found her on your list. I am 31, married, and we are childfree. First appt was 8/10, bi-salp was completed on 9/26. No bingos, no are you sures, though she did go over other options during the first appointment, but it sounded more like she had to go through the motions than anything. She also didn't ask if I was married or anything. Surgery went well, the whole team at IU North was great.

+1 Dr. Courtney Browne in Carmel, IN. The consult was quick and easy, she made sure I knew the procedure was permanent and approved me on the spot, no bingos and she respected that I’m childfree. Had the surgery about 2 months later and all went well. She is amazing! 27F 

+1 Dr. Courtney Browne, Nov 2022. I’m obese at 280 lbs (height 5’7) and my bisalp went perfectly! I was nervous because of my weight but my doctor didn’t bring it up once throughout the process and I healed just fine!

-1 to Dr. Courtney Browne in Carmel, Indiana. I chose her from this list as a follow-up after I'd had to go to the ER for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. I sent her all of my medical records in advance, which she neglected to read or skim, even the ER ones. She told me that my, "only option is an IUD." (My medical records would have shown her that I already had one.) I told her about my bleeding - she did not believe me, and even lied on my care summary that I had stopped bleeding even though I had not. When she reiterated that there, "are no other options." I fled her office in tears. I am glad that others have not suffered as I have, and I offer this as a caution that this might not be the best doctor to go to for anything but the most straightforward requests. My hope is that another doctor on this list will be willing to grant me a hysterectomy in the future. It's taken me this long to be brave enough to recount what happened with Dr. Browne, and it will be a while yet before I can be brave enough to try again.

+1 [Dr. Courtney Browne](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/courtney-a-browne-md-5131). I am a 30-year-old un-married woman and had my procedure done in December of 2022. During my consultation Dr. Browne did not give me any pushback and respected my choice to be childfree. She also did not ask about my marriage status. She just made sure that I was aware that this was a permanent procedure. The bi-salp surgery was a quick process and the team at IU North were extremely supportive and helpful.

+1 Dr. Courtney Browne. Jan 2023.My first time meeting with her, all she did was confirm my medical history and my desire for permanent sterilization; no questions about why, a partner's opinion, etc. She explained that she does permanent sterilization via laparoscopic bisalp. Our conversation was all of about 5 mins long, but I would rather spend 5 mins with a doctor that wholeheartedly respects and supports my decisions than spend 50 mins being bingoed by a doctor that doesn't respect bodily autonomy.

+1 Dr Courtney Browne, My girlfriend (25F) had bilateral salpingectomy done this past December, and I (24FTM) just had a partial hysterectomy (cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes were removed). Dr. Browne and her staff are extremely kind and never tried to do any sort of "gotcha" with myself or my girlfriend. She only asked the questions that were necessary for consenting to the procedures. Also, her surgery coordinator was excellent and helped us both navigate insurance coverage—everything was a total breeze!

+1 Dr Courtney Browne! I'm a 33yo single CF woman, and Dr. Browne didn't bingo me once. I really felt that she saw me as an individual with my own goals in life. She just had to check in right before the surgery to make sure I absolutely didn't want kids and didn't mind that it's permanent, I said yes, and she said "Great! Let's get you prepped!". She even gave me pictures taken during the procedure with notes about what I was looking at. On the completed picture she wrote: "No tubes! :)" Definitely a winner.

[Dr Stephanie Flora](https://healthcare.ascension.org/doctors/1417949397/stefanie-a-flora-carmel-in?utm_campaign=gmb-website&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google). I'm not married, never wanted kids. She didn't ask any questions just was happy to do it. Very friendly and helpful. I was referred to her by my gyno because she was retiring and no longer performing surgeries.

+1 Dr. Flora. As someone who’s always been terrified of hospitals and surgery, I had such a great overall experience!  I 10/10 recommend her to anyone in the Indianapolis area!

Dr. John Francis was excellent and I would highly recommend for other young child-free people. Was happy to do the procedure, no judgements and no questions asked. Operation went incredibly smoothly, was out the door 20 minutes after my appointment time. I asked if he commonly does the procedure for younger folks and he explained that he generally trusts people to make the best decision for themselves. Procedure costed $1000 ($850 with my insurance), and Columbus Regional Health has a generous financial aid program.

**Evansville** 

[Marcia Cave, Evansville, IN](https://www.deaconess.com/DocBio/167/Marcia_Cave_MD). She listened to my needs and reasoning for want to come off of birth control and wanting to get my tubes tied. She started the conversation with "I trust your decision and whatever you decide". We did discuss other options based on my medical history (heavy, painful periods which a tubal would not fix). Due to insurance, we couldn't schedule same day and have to wait till I get my pap results, but I can schedule it once those are in. She answered all questions I had about the two different kinds of Tubals and the recovery periods.

[Dr. John Reid](https://agapeobgyn.com/meet-the-team/). Tubal Ligation - age 22, single, no children. I initially saw Dr. Reid for all my appointments, then I saw Ashly Williams at the same office. I mentioned i wanted sterilized only twice, the second time she referred me back to Dr. Reid who only asked 1 time if I was sure, on the day of the surgery. I said yes, he said "Ok cool! Let's do it." No issues 2 years post-op.

+1 Dr. Reid. Bilateral salpingectomy. 26, single, no children. I saw the nurse practitioner and told her I wanted permanent birth control, specifically bilateral salpingectomy. She asked me one time if I was sure, informed me of the risks and then got the appointment scheduled with Dr. Reid.

Dr. Dawn Kirkwood in Evansville IN at the Deacconess women's hospital approved and completed. Had the consultation and 2 weeks the surgery was scheduled, occured in May. 14k surgery covered 95% by insurance (Anthem BCBS). Her only concern was that I was 100% sure, that she doesn't care about age life circumstances etc as long as you understand the repercussions and are ready (her words) No complications and very quick. I am 25 nonbinary not married with zero children

[Dr. Abbie Mincks](https://www.heradvantage.com/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am 27. I am single. And I am adamantly childfree. I had my yearly appointment and asked about a BS. My doctor asked if I was 100% sure I wanted that and I said yes. She said she would do it for me then and explained how the procedure would go. No bingoes. Only talked about options if I happened to change my mind. (Like IVF) My surgery appointment was set up the week after my yearly. So 3 weeks after the original appointment I had my surgery. My cost after the 20% discount of paying in full was a little over $3500.

[Dr. Ryan Arnold](https://www.heradvantage.com/provider/ryan-arnold/). Women's Health Advantage/DuPont Hospital Fort Wayne, IN. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 33 married no kids. Had a very good experience with the whole staff and Dr. Arnold. Very progressive team. They don't give push back except to make sure you know it's permanent and they ask you if your absolutely sure. After that it was smooth sailing. Sometimes there is a wait with regular appointments but usually not too long. Day of surgery was quick. Redirect Health Insurance denied my procedure because it's elective. Women's Health Advantage has a program called MDSave that brings down the price if insurance denies you. Original out of pocket price would have been $58,000. Using MDSave they brought it down to $8881. The stipulation to getting that discount though is that amount has to be paid before surgery so I took out a loan. https://nwlc.org/im-having-problems-insurance-coverage-essure-tubal-ligation-or-related-doctors-appointment/

**Huntington** 

[Dr. Matt Pflieger](https://www.happydadvasectomy.com), 29M/Married/Childfree. I called to set up an appointment and the only questions asked were age and when I wanted the procedure done. Friendly and never once asked about children or bingos.

+1 for Dr. Matt. mPfleiger. March 2023. Vasectomy on 33-year-old redditor. Scheduled my No Needle/No Scalpel open ended vasectomy online and just asked basic patient info. I signed one form just outlining the procedure and possible side-effects. Dr. Matt says he does not use Reddit but is aware he's on this list. When I asked about it, he stated why patients get the procedure "is none of my business," but does state he won't do anyone younger than 23. Very professional and no bingos or anything.

Dr. Pollydor in Huntington Indiana. They are in the parkview hospital there, but she is past of Lutheran hospital network. (For insurance).  You do have to be 21 years old. And there is a 30 day wait.

**Indianapolis**

[Dr Brittany Bither](https://www.indyhealthnet.org/physicians/brittany-bither?__ptLanguage=en-US), it was a quick “you know this is permanent” and then she was ready for me to be in the queue for surgery. The entire procedure was covered by the Healthy Indiana Plan if that helps some other women make the decision to use her and Barington.

[Donna Tisch, MD](https://fad.ecommunity.com/provider/Donna+Eshenroder+Tisch/186157), this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am a gynecologist in Indiana (Indianapolis) who will perform bilateral salpingectomy for sterilization to any well informed individual without judgement or hardship"

Dr. Nabila Zambrano at Community Physician Network OB/GYN Care - laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy - 32 cf and received 0 pushback. Had appointment in May and had procedure 4 weeks later.

[Dr.  P. Snyder, MD LLC](http://www.nostork.com/). Vasectomy performed December 2022. Mid-30s, married, childfree. Intake forms asked about children, marital status, and if your partner is aware, but does not require them to be. Consultation and procedure performed on the same day, I was in the office for a total of about 25 minutes. He asked once before starting the procedure - "no kids, and want to keep it that way? Great." No Bingos at all, in fact mentioned a lot of his patients never wanted to have children. All communication handled via email, was able to schedule within 2-3 weeks.

[Dr. Hilary Gaudreau, MD](https://www.obgynindiana.com/doctor/hilary-gaudreau-md/) (Bilateral Salpingectomy)

+1 Dr Gaudreau, She did also say during my consultation that 18 year olds are adults, and starting from that age she believes they should be allowed to make decisions about their bodies. She said some other really affirming things too. Just a fantastic, empathetic woman.

[Dr Meredith Bellamy](https://axiawh.com/providers/bellamy-meredith/), Southside OBGYN Indianapolis, IN. Bilateral Tubal Salpingectomy. 27 years old, single and one pregnancy that ended in adoption almost 9 years ago. Wait time was due to working around my schedule. Aetna insurance covered everything. I did deal with a few bingos but they were to be sure this was what I really wanted. I felt she was just covering her bases because previous patients had assumed it was reversible. She was extremely professional and made it clear that she would do what I wanted because it was my body. She knows about this sub and told me to be sure she was put on it.

[Dr. Leslie Foxlow, Southside OBGYN](https://axiawh.com/providers/foxlow-leslie/) I'm 25, single, with no kids. Never been pregnant. I had a both my tubes removed. I talked to Dr. Foxlow and she was super respectful. Only time changing my mind came up was when discussing what type of tubal to do, like whether to completely remove my tubes or clip. I also brought up doing a hysterectomy because I have endometriosis and she would have done that, I just needed to keep my ovaries so I wouldn't go into menopause. She explained that medically it's not good to do that at my age for bone heath and stuff. I choose to do the tubal instead because keeping my ovaries wouldn't help with my endometriosis and the recovery time is less for a tubal. I was originally told I would have to wait a month to get the surgery because of insurance but was later told that was only if I had Medicare.

[Dr Melissa Holt](https://fad.ecommunity.com/provider/Melissa+Dolly+Rappleye+Holt/186275) I'm 35f never married CF and Doctor Holt performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me per my request. She did go over all birth control options but did not try to persuade me against sterilization.

[Kelly Kasper @ IU Health](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/Kelly-m-Kasper-md-7166). I’m 32F, married, and childfree. Waited 6 weeks to get in for consult and 4 months for surgery due to full surgery schedule. She didn’t ask any questions about why I wanted procedure after I expressed I wanted sterilized. Excellent bedside manner and surgery team.

Dr Sarah Crane. (bilateral salpingectomy). With Community Hospitals. She is one of the most amazing doctors I have ever had. I’m 28, and no children. I let her know I was considering it and she said once I was ready she would happily do it for me. A month later I called her office to schedule a preop once my insurance confirmed they would cover it. I had my preop appointment 2 days later and they were ready to schedule my surgery 3 weeks after the preop.

Daniel Feeney with Community Health East in Indianapolis. I just got a tubal and the doctor I went to didn't bingo me, didn't say I'll change my mind, and didn't ask if I had a husband. I'm a 28F who has never been married and has no kids. The conversation only went as far as "it's permanent so you need to be sure" and I said right then and there that I was and it was scheduled for surgery the next month. No questions asked the day of surgery either. No one tried to talk me out of it. It was very easy and very smooth and I'm actually shocked at how it went.

-1 Dr Feeney, He bingoed me, forced me to wait 6 months after I had been asking consistently for 3 years prior, also said 'it's different when it's your own', acted shocked when I had legitimate knowledge of sterilization procedures whuch felt extremely rude, and was caught up in how my boyfriend felt and really pushed the IUD on me hard. Also does not do bisalps. I am 21F

[Dr. Christina Harris](https://axiawh.com/providers/harris-christina/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 27, single, no children at all. It took a month to get in for a consultation, and another month for surgery. Procedure covered by insurance in full by Anthem BCBS as per the Affordable Care Act. Dr Harris was understanding. She did ask, however, if I felt I would change my mind about not wanting children if I were to get into a relationship later down the line. I said no. No sterilization binder was made. You just have to be confident in your decision and show that to her. She may tell you multiple times that the procedure is permanent.

[Dr Brianna Leachman-Haab, MD, FACOG](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/brianna-l-leachman-haab-md-7600) (Tubal Ligation and Ablation) 26F, single, CF, she did not judge at all and did the surgery within a month of consultation. 

+1 Dr Haab, She approved me for a Tubal/Bi Salp at 21. She had said at my consultation that she had approved 8 sterilizations in the past 5 days. Her only requirement is that you be 21 to get the procedure. She is super professional and only walks you through the procedure of making sure this is what you want and does not bingo you.

+1 Dr Haab, (29NB - Bilateral Salpingectomy) My regular women's health doctor personally recommended Dr. Haab as an option for my bisalp, and I am extremely happy with my experience with her. The process of having the consultation and signing documents (Dec 28th) all the way up to the day of surgery (Mar 6th) was extremely smooth-sailing. Dr. Haab went over the usual checklist — such as asking me if I understood it was permanent or if I was somehow being pressured or influenced to have the procedure done — but at no point during these mandatory pre-procedure questions did she use bingo-ing language, ask invasive or inappropriate questions, or combat my personal decisions. Dr. Haab (along with every other staff member involved) was extremely welcoming and went above and beyond in answering my questions and walking me through things step-by-step. I couldn't have asked for a better doctor!

[Dr. Reisman, MD, FACS](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/john-d-reisman-md-8906) (Vasectomy). Did the consultation and procedure in the same visit. Very courteous and respectful doctor, no bingo-ing or judgment whatsoever.

-1 Dr Reisman, "My boyfriend went in for a vasectomy consultation with him and was told that although he was physically fine for surgery he was "not comfortable" doing it to someone aged 20 because "you might regret it when you're older.""

[Debra J. Madura, MD, FACOG | IU Health](https://iuhealth.org/find-providers/provider/debra-j-madura-md-7831) I got a bi-salp. She agreed to do an ablation however my anatomy would not allow for it. I am not married but have been in a relationship for almost 7 years, no kids (none birthed, adopted, or from him either). She did not bingo but went over risks, said regret was possible and she'd had a few people that had regret. Did not push me not to have it at all, was impressed I'd done my research into what I wanted. She did say she won't (or didn't like, I don't recall) doing ablations without some other procedure for bc, and a partner's vasectomy could be one of those, just due to the danger of getting pregnant after an ablation.

**Logansport**

If you need some reliable contraception (especially something long acting like an IUD or nexplanon) I am always taking new patients. I also perform salpingectomies (removal of Fallopian tubes) for those of you done with childbearing or for those who know you don't want children. [Message me](https://www.facebook.com/1191510194/posts/pfbid02RsCQdubC8mT4ZoF1bn6tu6mCp5Y5DGsxSEnCjSgQf5v2DnFFqwofUSNyh9xuq4S8l/?app=fbl) and I can get you in sooner than if you call office. 

+1 Dr. Kennedy. Nov 2022 Bisalp on 25-year old redditor. She walked in and sat down and asked me what I wanted plain and simple. I explained to her everything and she went "Okay, let's do it." and I was scheduled that same day for a surgery a month out. She's one of those doctors that walks in and you immediately know you're in good hands.

-1 Dr Khalid, was extremely rude and condensing throughout the appointment and ended up denying my request to have the procedure done. She suggested that I stay on my long-term birth control method until I was older.

Dr. Derek Voss of IU Health Obstetrics & Gynecology, previously called the Voss Center. Bilateral Salpingectomy. I just turned 30 and he told me he would have approved me in my 20s. Very kind and no bingos, just the normal rundown they have to give you when talking about the procedure.

Dr. Moore was completely fine with doing the procedure with someone as young as myself. I even brought up my age and he said "you're a consenting adult so as long as you're wanting it, I'll do it". Explained the whole procedure and made sure I was 100% certain. Scheduled it for 2 months out and just had it done.

[Dr. Lin Lu](https://www.hchcares.org/lin-lu-do-mba/) I am 30 years old, have never wanted children, and originally went to get an ablation. Saw Dr. Lu and he immediately was open to the idea, but he suggested a hysterectomy & keep the ovaries. I agreed after discussing that the ablation doesn't always keep periods at bay. Had about 4 appts total so that insurance would approve it due to heavy periods, and 2 months later had a hysterectomy done. 16 weeks post op and I would recommend him 100%. Have had no issues in recovery and he trusted in my decision to be childfree and never questioned it twice.

Is aware that she is in the wiki and is delighted to be part  of the resource, from which she gets a lot of traffic.

+1 Dr Murphy,  She was wonderful - no bingos, just easy acceptance. Had a consult on July 25th, pre-up consultation on August 5th and my surgery on August 23rd. She bills as a tubal ligation via bilateral salpingectomy so my insurance covered it completely and she takes the full tubes and cauterizes the ends to boot.

I am 31, never been pregnant, in a long term relationship with a man who also has no children. My surgical consultation was my first meeting with Dr. Sides. I had discussed the procedure at my last annual, but the provider I had been seeing is no longer with the practice. Dr. Sides reviewed that provider's notes before meeting with me, and when I told him what I wanted, he confirmed that I understood it was permanent, discussed the process and recovery of the surgery, and generally never asked me anything other than "You sure? Ok, let's get it scheduled." I truly appreciated his lack of bingos or questions about what my partner felt. On the day of the procedure, the facility was timely, and all the nurses and other providers were kind and again, no bingos! The whole team was fantastic. I would recommend any woman in the area go see Dr. Sides if they want to be sterilized.

**Whiteland** 

Dr Emily D Cline, MD. This gynecologist consults from Whiteland and operates at Johnson Memorial in Franklin Indiana. Office phone number is 317-738-0630. This gynecologist has contact us directly to advise, "I am happy to provide sterilization procedures to women who choose to be child free." and "If a patient is of legal age, I am happy to help her. Together we can find the sterilization procedure that is best suited to her. Women who are some distance away can request that the initial consultation be via telemedicine in order to limit the amount of travel required."

+1 Dr Cline, 26F, she did a bisalp for me, no questions other than to make sure I knew it was permanent. I had one virtual appt with her (live several hours away) and then met her at the hospital a month later for day of my surgery. 10/10, she's great.

[Dr Emily Zoulek DO](https://www.mcfarlandclinic.com/doctors/emily-zoulek)
Medical Arts Building Office, 1015 Duff Avenue, Ames, IA 50010, 515-239-4414. Bisalp on 22-year-old CF redditor, Sept 2022. At the consult months before, she walked in, sat down and said "tell me your story". No pushback aside from confirming I understand the permanence of the procedure. Very kind and concise. At the end of consultation she said "whenever you are ready to have your surgery just give me a call". She found endo in my surgery, so she gave treatment options INCLUDING a hysterectomy if I so wished, saying: "plenty of people in their 20s have hysterectomies and are just fine" She respected that I wasn't quite ready for that and will work with me on other options as I progress without hormonal contraceptives. Very patient-led.



**Boone** 

[Dr. Tracey McIntyre, DO, FACOOG](https://www.iowaspecialtyhospital.com/doctors/tracey-mcintire). Bilateral Salpingectomy, 32, in a long term relationship, never been pregnant. I was referred to her by my doctor in a different city, I waited about a month to get in to see her. I told her that I wanted to be sterilized and she immediately suggested the bisalp, absolutely no bingos. She scheduled my surgery 30 days after this. All of my visits, the surgery, and the follow-ups were covered by my insurance. She performed the surgery herself and repaired a ruptured ovarian cyst while she was in there. The only red flag from her was sharing with me that a 20 year old patient had asked for the same procedure, and she had refused it due to a lack of any sexual partners or a previous relationship. She told me she quickly agreed to do my surgery no questions asked due to my age, so YMMV.

I did not experience any bingos as an overweight 20something unmarried woman, although Dr. Bemus said during my consultation: "Ten years ago I may have asked a bunch of questions, but you seem sure and it's a common procedure nowadays. If you change your mind, and I'm not saying you will, there's always IVF." Overall, he was very friendly, answered my questions and didn't make me defend my decision. He did initially refer to the procedure as Tubal Ligation, even though I have confirmed it will be a bisalp (I was fine with either).

He works for the same practice as Dr. Andrew Lightfoot, who is also on the list of childfree friendly doctors. When I went in for a consultation, he simply explained the procedure, the risks involved, and what to expect. He didn't even ask me if I was sure if this is what I wanted. He only suggested freezing sperm if I was worried about changing my mind, and that was the closest thing regarding any potential regret. He simply stated the risks and said he would schedule me.

[Jana Van Rybroek and Briana R. Barclay](https://obgyngroup.com/), Barclay was my initial doctor and we scheduled my bilateral salpingectomy, but she did not do the procedure due to her being called away to a child birth. Jana Van Rybroek met with me instead and we scheduled to do it sooner than Barclay would have been available. I faced no opposition from either women which was really surprising because I am 22F with 0 kids. I got the surgery done in May 2022.

Bisalp on 25-year-old redditor. This doctor will not sterilize women under 25. I explained that I had researched the surgery and knew which option I wanted, and stressed a lifelong history of not wanting kids. The doctor stated he usually works with women in the 28 to 30+ range, and because I was so young I had my initial appointment where surgery was scheduled, and I had a followup about a week before the surgery so he could confirm I hadn't changed my mind. I didn't mind it, overall it was incredibly easy to get done. I was prepared for a fight and he definitely did not give me one.

I scheduled my appointment after the Supreme Court draft leaked and was one week post-op when they released the final decision June 24th.

Doctor did not bingo me in any way and only asked one time, to verify that I understand, that the procedure was permanent and non-reversable. I did bring my husband to the appointment to avoid any bingos, but the doctor did not ask my husband for permission in any way, just asked if he had any questions about the procedure and what to expect while taking care of me post op. Very professional. I did not need to plead my case in any way, just stated what I wanted and that my goal was to be sterilized, and he immediately got on board. Did not ask of I wanted to try a different birth control or anything.

Dr. Sayer approved my bisalpingectomy without bingos. She believes in body autonomy and immediately scheduled me. I am 29, single, no kids, never married. Birth Control was hard on my body & I know I don’t want kids. I told her that and she said okay, let’s do this.

[Enrique R. Bedia, MD](https://doctors.unitypoint.org/provider/Enrique+R.+Bedia/1166980?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=brandify)

+1 Dr Bedia,  I (f,25) had a bilateral salpingectomy a little over a month ago in Des Moines, Iowa! My doctor was amazing and didn’t bingo me a single time just explicitly went over consequences/side effects. The clinic was Unity Point Health Clinic OBGYN Lakeview West Des Moines, Iowa and my surgeon was Dr. Bedia. Also I was still 24 when I had the surgery preformed!

+1 Dr Bedia, but he will only perform Bisalp or Tubals. I am a 22F without children and he was willing to do the procedure. He DID however bingo me about not having caregivers when I am elderly and was very adamant that I could change my mind at every appointment including when I was climbing on his table in the OR.
The experience was not negative, but people pursuing care with Dr bedia should be adamant about their choice.

Jennifer Schuchmann MD with OBGYN Associates of Des Moines, in Des Moines, Iowa. She just confirmed I knew it was permanent and could not be reversed, then just ran through the typical “this is a medical procedure and comes with these risks”. She was always direct with facts and was upfront with she believes women should be the ones making these decisions for themselves and she will do everything to support that.

**Dubuque** 

Dr. Curtis Page [Dubuque Obstetrics-Gynecology](http://www.dbqobgyn.com/) 1500 Delhi St # 3100, Dubuque, IA 52001 (563) 557-5959 : does sterilization for women without much trouble. Of course they do have to educate before they agree but it was one office visit and I'm already scheduled.

Sarah HIRSCH, and I primarily practice in Dubuque, Iowa in a private practice known as Dubuque OBGYN. I would be happy to provide sterilization to any person (regardless of marital status and/or childbearing status). Obviously, we need to meet and make sure the procedure is safe for you and you have been appropriately counseled about all your options for bodily autonomy. Welcoming to those of all backgrounds and all parts of the LGBTQ+ community.

**Fort Dodge** 

[Dr. Ilene Olson - UnityPoint Clinic](https://www.unitypoint.org/fortdodge/provider.aspx?id=181&amp;clinicid=174). Sterilized a 25 year old woman with no children. No remarks or questioning the decision whatsoever, just a one month mandatory waiting period to think it over.

**Grinnell**

[Elizabeth Tigges, DO, FACOG] (https://grinnell.unitypoint.org/search?unified=Elizabeth+Tigges+&sort=relevance%2Cnetworks%2Cavailability_density_best) UnityPoint Health – Grinnell Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, 202 4th Avenue, AMAB, Floor 3, Suite 300, Grinnell, IA 50112, 641-236-2905. Bisalp on 32-year-oldCF redditor. Warning! Doctor is inconsistent and can be unprofessional. Approach only with all your reasoning and facts prepared. She summarily refused to sterilize a 32-year-old without any knowledge other than the person had no children, and only agreed after extensive education by the patient.

At first things did not go well. The doctor came in, immediately exclaiming she wouldn't tie my tubes. I might find a doctor who will, but it's unnecessary as a vasectomy is considered more effective, so unless I'm having sex with someone else.... Where I live there's no access to safe abortion. So I explained that after roe v wade was overturned I'm terrified of being raped and impregnated. I start to go into my whole speech of also what if my spouse dies before I go into menopause and.... Where I live there's no access to safe abortion. 

My doctor immediately agrees that she understands that reasoning and will do that for me. She then goes on to say she forgets people are afraid of being raped because she figures she'd kill someone if they tried, but honestly has no upper body strength so it would probably be futile. And then goes on that she understands bad things can happen, she doesn't go to bars or out at night but really that doesn't matter, it was just so strange the way she rambled on about it. The procedure went great and my doctor, after the rough start, has been completely professional and respectful. Even took extra photos of the procedure and explained them in my post op. Had no problem prescribing pain meds and even anxiety meds.

[Keely Ulmer, MD, UIHC](uihc.org/keely-k-ulmer) - bilateral salpingectomy. Keely was friendly and receptive for bilateral on an overweight, single 25f with no kids; on my very first visit, she said she would perform the surgery whenever I was comfortable with no additional wait period, no bingos. I also suggest Dr. Grace Breuer at UIHC Family Medicine, who clearly stated she would be my ally and referred me to Keely. 

[Noelle C. Bowdler, MD, UIHC](https://uihc.org/noelle-c-bowdler) - bilateral salpingectomy. Preformed the procedure with no bingos on single 26F with no kids. Friendly. NB may not be taking new patients at this time. 

[Dr Kelly Ferroni, Iowa City, Iowa](https://uihc.org/providers/kelly-l-ferroni) Bilateral salpingectomy on 26F, not married, no kids. No push for IUD or other birth control methods. No bingos, no wait period (OR was booked, and just had to wait for open scheduling). Polite, friendly, no nonsense. She was pregnant herself when she performed the operation.

**Sioux City** 

[Dr. Mary Schneider, MD, OB/GYN.](https://siouxlandwomenshealth.com/) Bilateral Salpingectomy at age 25. Also agreed to my bilateral salpingectomy at age 23. I brought my binder but she didn't look at it. At first she wanted to clamp my tubes but I asked about the bi-salp instead and she agreed. She did make sure I knew that it was likely irreversible and I could possibly regret it, but she respected my choice and scheduled my surgery for a month later. 

[Dr. Jamie Olsen, DO.](https://www.fountainpointmedical.com/find-a-doctor/jamie-olsen/). Works in both Sioux City, IA and Norfolk, NE. 22, have fiancé, no children, I encountered minimal pushback from Doctor. Asked the obvious questions about why, but after I let know my reasons he said I seemed mature enough and have thought it through. Did request to speak with fiancé before appt to make sure they were on board as well, but also said even if they weren’t it’s my choice in the end. Very professional and nice doctor. As long as you’re confident with the decision, I don’t think they will have a problem.

**Waterloo** 

[Dr. Elizabeth Boggs MD. UnityPoint obgyn](https://doctors.unitypoint.org/provider/Elizabeth+Boggs/2149566), "I am an obgyn in Waterloo Iowa at UnityPoint and offer sterilization to anyone who wants it. Full disclosure that I do counsel about the availability of LARCS and the irreversible nature of bilateral salpingectomy (as that is part of informed consent) but there aren’t any hoops to jump through. Ive done two bilateral salpingectomies for nulliparous women since I started here in October." 

+1 Did a bisalp for a 22-year-old CF woman: She is super friendly to the idea of doing this for younger people. She wants to know that you truly want this done and know that it is a permanent procedure, but other than that age isn't really too much of a concern for her.

Dr. Elizabeth Baker, bilateral salpingectomy for 40yo. Fun fact: At my initial consultation, she asked if I vote "because voting affects reproductive rights."

###KANSAS

**Chanute** 

Dr. Dawne Lowden at the Neosho Memorial Woman’s health clinic, tubal ligation 21F. She came in, introduced herself to us (my boyfriend was in the room) and just said “Listen. You’re an adult if this is what you want, I can do it 1 of 3 ways.” She then continued to explain everything in an enormous amount of detail. Answered all questions, she let me choose the way she would do the surgery. She did have to throw some statistics about regret being higher the younger something like this is done.

+1 Dr Grey was super supportive and didn't second guess my decision to have the surgery at all. She performed the surgery using the vNOTES method which results in no external scarring and faster healing. 28, bilateral salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Abigail Proffer](https://www.joco-obgyn.com/providers/abigail-proffer-md), Merriam, KS (suburb of Kansas City, Kansas). Bilateral Tubal Ligation with Filshie Clips 24f, single, childfree. Dr. Proffer readily agreed to a tubal ligation after discussing all birth control options with me (24f). She wanted to make sure I was “1000, 1000 percent sure” but also said that I know myself best and basic health care like sterilization should be accessible. It took about a month from my first visit with her to the surgery. Was fully covered by insurance. This doctor does offer full tube removal but advises insurance likely won't cover it. 

Dr Natasha Ahmed, Town Plaza Women's Health. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I’m an OBGYN in Kansas City and my partners and I are all happy to provide sterilization procedures. We strongly believe people should be in control of their own bodies. Our group is Town Plaza Women’s Health and we take *almost* all insurances including KS and MO Medicaid."

+1 [Dr Ahmed](https://mymidwestphysician.com/locationstown-plaza-womens-health), she performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me in 2019. 35/F, childfree, married, first request. I just spoke with her (2022) and asked her if she would perform sterilizations on childfree people over the age of 18 upon request and she confirmed that she would as well as any of the other doctors in her practice. The office is located in Leawood, Kansas (suburb of Kansas City) and the address is 15137 Rosewood St, Leawood, Kansas 66224. 

Dr Valerie French, tubal ligation. No kids, no spouse or partner. I just went in and let Dr. French know that I wasn’t interested in having kids and she said any reason you want to get sterilized is reason enough for me. And she treated me with respect and it was honestly an amazing experience!

[Dr. Austin Findley](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/ob-gyn/faculty/austin-findley-md-mscr-facog.html) KU Medical Center: (913) 588-1227. Approved 29/F unmarried CF woman for bilateral salpingectomy. Only questions asked were to ensure I understood the procedure's permanence and the inherent risks of surgery, and that I was sure this is what I wanted. Made a point of affirming that I'm an adult capable of determining what's best for myself. 

[Dr. Madhuri Reddy](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/ob-gyn/faculty/madhuri-reddy-md-facog.html) KU Medical Center: (913) 588-9200. Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. Approved 28/F unmarried woman. Never asked about me having a partner. Approved over Zoom appointment during pandemic. Mentioned she's wary on doing it on patients under 25 with no children. Asked me what I would do if I hypothetically regretted my decision later. I told her in that unlikely event that I would adopt because I believe a lot of people have children they can't take care of who long for a home. She asked me why I wanted this and I said that it's something I've wanted since I was old enough to know better. That I wanted my decision as an adult to not want to procreate to be taken as seriously as people take a 16 year old who says she wants to keep her baby. Approved me right after that. Extremely nice and never asked "are your sure?" Even right before the surgery, just asked how I was feeling. Really felt like she took what I was saying seriously and never made me feel like I didn't know what I wanted.

[Kimberly Swan](https://mymidwestphysician.com/locations/specialists-in-womens-care) at the Overland Park location of Specialists in Women’s Care in the Kansas City metro area. I also met with Dr. Dougherty (spelling? It’s listed nowhere), who was also very friendly and supportive. Apparently Dr. Swan is in very high demand and had a long wait time for an initial appointment (September). I made an appointment with Dr. Dougherty, and Dr. Swan ended up coming in to the appointment anyway since she’d be the surgeon. I managed to get my procedure done with Dr. Swan before my initial appointment with her would have been by going this route.

Patients can expect thorough informed consent which includes reviewing surgical risks, benefits, alternatives (LARC or other contraceptive options may be reviewed). Our group primarily performs a laparoscopic total salpingectomy for tubal sterilization- i.e., removal of the entire Fallopian tube. We accept most insurances including Medicaid, Medicare.

[Dr. Amanda Healy](https://wcjcobgyn.com/our-providers/amanda-healy/) at the Women's Clinic of Johnson County in Olathe, KS. At my first appointment with her, I asked for sterilization. She was supportive and told me she suggests Bilateral Salpingectomy. The next day, surgery called me to book my pre-op, surgery, and post-op appointments. My surgery went great. She never asked if I spoke to my husband about it, made sure to emphasize that this is my choice alone and made me feel safe. My insurance covered it fully as preventative care (Aetna). Amazing experience! I would 10/10 recommend her to anyone in the Johnson County Kansas area looking for a childfree friendly doctor for sterilization.  24F, childfree, married, Bilat Salp.

Hysterectomy on CF redditor, March 2022.  She was incredibly supportive and made me feel safe. She explicitly said that she doesn't question people on why they want to be sterilized, the most she asked is that I had a final conversation with my husband to make sure we were on the same page, she would've gone through with it either way.

Dr. Davis was completely supportive of my decision despite my age, gave the legal counseling (only took 5 minutes) to make sure I actually wanted to follow through with the surgery, even said she did the same procedure to someone only a year older than me. Reassured me she’d make sure I got the surgery no matter what happened with Roe V Wade. Even got a pap and my endometriosis lining off since I was under. Super pro-choice and pro woman.

[Dr. Merle “Boo” Hodges](https://www.salinawomensclinic.com/meet-our-providers/) - 501 S Santa Fe Ave Salina, KS 67401 United States. 22(NB AFAB) going for hysterectomy, no children. Dr. Boo took me very seriously. Originally wanted to do a tubal ligation, but listened to my concerns and my history and agreed that a hysterectomy would be best for me. Scheduled 5 months out for a checkup before scheduling surgery, I will update at that time. Didn’t ask about my spouse, didn’t ask if I had kids, and told me “we all have to live in the bodies god gave us. All we can do is try to make it a more comfortable experience. You have to live your life.” Assured me he had performed tubals for patients as young as 21. Did have a requirement to remain his patient for a year, but given the current political climate he isn’t being too strict about it as long as you have a solid case. The nurses were super friendly and not one of them ever tried to guilt me or make me change my mind. 10/10 experience. 

+1 Dr Hodges, He listened to me thoroughly, and never questioned my decision— despite only being 22. They explored the physical pain I feel, and discovered PCOS, which will require an oophorectomy at a much later date. We have decided to leave my ovaries until after 35 to prevent heart disease and osteoporosis— though Dr.Hodges made it clear that it was my choice and he is here to help with whatever I decided. He gave me the pros and cons and let me decide. His nurses (and his main nurse, Beth,) are amazing and so incredibly supportive. They all worked together to cover all the insurance bases to get this done. A friend of mine had a tubal approved at that same clinic by another doctor (I don’t remember their name.) they are AFAB 25, and once again— an amazing consult and approval. Their surgery is scheduled in September. NB the hospital where OP was operated on disregarded OP's pronouns.

Approved 26/F, didn't ask about partner's thoughts. Said she doesn't like to do sterilizations on this age group due to high rate of regret, but agreed after I confirmed this is definitely what I want and she didn't second guess my decision. Scheduled and performed surgery a month after first appointment with her.

-1 Dr Hague refused a hysterectomy and has been dismissive of other health issues with another patient. 

Dr. James Whiddon - Heartland Women's Group. I asked my doctor last week about sterilization and he was awesome! He said he's done procedures on women as young as 21 just because they wanted it. Gave me no pushback whatsoever. Literally said as long as insurance covers it (or I can afford it without) it's 100% my choice.

###KENTUCKY

**Bellevue**

[Dr. Thomas Fellens](http://www.healthpointfc.org/provider/thomas-fellens-md/)- hates the notion that everyone wants a kid, provided a referral for Endometrial Ablation to a 27 yo female to treat dysmenorrhea.

**Bowling Green** 

[Dr. Roger Sandelin MD](https://www.gravesgilbert.com/physicians/roger-sandelin-m-d/). I am 30, never married, child free. Dr Sandelin provided a full hystorectomy for me with no questions asked. I asked for the procedure, and he provided within a month or so of me requesting it.

[Dr. Samer Kalakish](https://www.gravesgilbert.com/physicians/samer-r-kalakish-m-d/). Vasectomy - Dr. Kalakish gave absolutely no pushback on a 29 yo male with no kids getting a vasectomy. Very pro-patient and patient choice.

Dr. Jarrett Sutton 1805 Scottsville Rd Bowling Green, Kentucky 42101 (270)781-3415 I’m 24 and had no pushback when requesting sterilization. The only things required were that I be 21 years old and if married, my partner would have to sign as well. They said this was due to Kentucky state law. I’m not sure. He wasn’t keen on the idea of a bisalp, mostly due to the hospital’s current equipment, so I went forward with a tubal ligation. 

**Nicholasville**

[Dr. Jennifer Fuson](https://axiawh.com/providers/fuson-jennifer/). The only stipulation the doctors had was that you must be 21 years or older (I'm 34). There were no other questions asked, and no husband or father permission needed! 

-1 Dr Fuson, her decision was that I’m too young and might regret it. She definitely didn’t care about my child free values or my personal and medical reasons for the procedure and only cared I might end up wanting kids in the future.

**Lexington** 

[Dr. R. Brenton Terrell](http://www.lexingtonclinic.com/staff/commonwealthurology/rbrentonterrell.html) (Vasectomy) - Based out of Mt. Sterling but is affiliated with Lexington Clinic so has office hours in Lexington weekly. Performed vasectomy despite being 25 and childless/single.

[Dr. Emily Cunningham](https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/physicians/emily-cunningham), OB/GYN Lexington, KY  Bilateral salpingectomy at age 25 performed. She treated me with so much respect and was the first doctor to actually listen to my wants and concerns. She's excellent.

[Dr. McGregor, Andrew](https://www.lexingtonclinic.com/staff/urology/andrewcmcgregor.html) (Vasectomy) - Dr. McGregor is highly qualified and has performed thousands of vasectomies. Only 1 short-term recanalization story which was caught very early with semen analysis. 18+ No complications &amp;amp; Zero bingos. Excellent staff and an overall positive atmosphere. Highly recommend! 

Dr. Justin Johnson at the Lexington Clinic. Lexington, Kentucky, USA. Ask to have it done in the office, not the surgery center—it cuts about 60-70% off of the cost. Called and scheduled an appointment without any referral. Consult was about 15 minutes, wanted to make sure I was aware of the risks and benefits and that I was aware the decision was likely permanent/difficult to reverse if I changed my mind. No BINGOs. Surgery took about 15 minutes. No scalpel, cautery method was used. Minimal pain and minimal recovery time. Offered pain meds which I refused. Overall good experience.

[Dr. Allison D. Cook](https://www.baptisthealth.com/provider/allison-d-cook-md-obstetrics-gynecology). Lexington Women's Health, PLLC. 1720 Nicholasville Road Suite 702 Lexington, Kentucky 40503. She performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on me at the age of 26. The consult lasted less than 5 minutes. She told me that as long as I'm 21 years old, know this is what I want and that I have no regrets, then I can do whatever I want with my body. She also stressed that it's not the end of the world if I get the surgery done and have regrets later on as I can still undergo IVF to conceive a biological child. It took them a week to run my insurance and call me back to schedule a surgery. They let me schedule the surgery as soon as two weeks after the consult if I had wished to. The surgery was fast, simple, and I was released home after about 2 hours (1 hour prep/surgery, 1 hour recovery). I was prescribed pain medication (Oxycodone and Ibuprofen) from their pharmacy on site, but so far I have not needed it in during my recovery. This was the first doctor I had contacted in my search for sterilization, and I was thankful that she did not give me any grief, was incredibly understanding, and was supportive of women's rights to their own anatomy and well-being.

+1 Dr Cook, bilateral salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Mark Hoffman](https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/doctorsmark-hoffman) University of Kentucky Women’s Hospital. 125 East Maxwell Street, Lexington, Kentucky 40502. 859-323-0005. Bilateral Salpingectomy. 28 years old, single. Medicaid covered 100%, I paid $0. At consultation I explained my reasons for wanting a bilateral salpingectomy (don’t want children, lower risk of reproductive cancers). He replied it was his duty to inform me of other options; I told him I was aware, but wanted something permanent. If he was willing to surgically place an IUD, why not the option that lasts a lifetime with no maintenance? He agreed, but asked if I was aware some women change their minds. I said yes, 6.3% of women regret it but most of them were already mothers coerced into it by others. I added that if I met someone and they wanted kids then they wouldn’t be “the one” for me, and my marital status wouldn’t change anything. He asked when I wanted to book the surgery and 1 month later I was sterile! 10/10 would recommend.

+1 Dr Hoffman, I was able to get mine from him at 23 with no kids, no husband/bf, so this doc is open to doing this procedure on younger women as well! 

William R Rankin. Address: 230 W Main St #102, Danville, KY 40422. He was very professional, and completely understood my child-free position, and was supportive of it. Procedure was done in less than 30 minutes. Performed vasectomy for 19yo CF. 

Dr Sarah Borders of Lexington Ky. I got a Bi Salp. I’m 28 and married.

[Brian K. Rone - Lexington, Kentucky](https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/doctors/bryan-rone). Bilateral salpingectomy. Just extremely uncomplicated and professional. Treated me like adult and everyone I interacted with was just as good. Took about 6 months total between scheduling the consultation and having the procedure.

[Dr. Clarissa S Beiting](https://www.lexingtonclinic.com/services/gynecology) - Dr. Beiting performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me, 27F, married with no kids. She was kind and understanding throughout the process and didn't bingo me once. At the consultation, she went over other long term birth control options, the pros and cons of surgery, what it would entail, and that I understood it was permanent. Her only requirements were that I was 21 and knew this is what I wanted. Surgery experience was smooth and I was relaxing at home the same day. I was prescribed ondansetron, hydrocodone and ibuprofen, but have only needed the anti-nausea medicine so far.

**Louisville** 

[Dr. Celia O'Brien MD](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Celia+M+O'Brien/1597775) Women's Care Physicians of Louisville, 4130 Dutchmans Lane, Suite 400, Louisville, KY 40207, 502-897-0697. April 2023. Bisalp on 24-year-old redditor. Husband's presence or permission was not required. Consultation was quick, polite, and straight to the point. Did not ask if I was sure about my choice, just walked me through other contraceptive options. Is happy to answer any questions. Highly professional and nonjudgmental.

[Kris Ellen Barnsfather](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Kris+E+Barnsfather/490910). OBGYN. Performing a bilateral tubal ligation for me, a 26 year old child free woman. Dr. B never asked my relationship status/what my partner thought and was horrified when I mentioned being previously turned away for my age and not already having children. Stated she was willing to do this for anyone around 23+ who understood the full scope of the procedure.

Dr. Reed Nett, MD and Bianca Weaver, PRN both at Advocates for Women's Health in Louisville, KY. Bianca Weaver is the Nurse Practitioner who works with her. I went in for an annual with Weaver and mentioned I’d like to talk about a tubal. She scheduled me with Dr. Nett right then and there, and said they would only rule out the procedure for a patient who wants it if it would be too high risk for the patient’s individual case. Age or previous children (or lack thereof) not a factor.

[Dr. Robert B Hendren](http://www.louisvilleurology.com/). Vasectomy

[Dr. Christopher Shrepferman](https://1sturology.com/team/schrepferman-c/). Vasectomy - Performed a vasectomy at only 20 years of age. Spoke about it being an adult decision so doing so at 18 is likely as well.

[Dr. Lynn Parker, M.D. oncologist-gynecologist] (https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Lynn+P+Parker/486592) Norton Cancer Institute. Brought up sterilization with 23 year old  and performed salpingectomy three weeks after first appointment. She only sees patients with cancer or high-risk of cancer because of her specialty.

[Dr. Kenneth Payne (MD)](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Kenneth+J+Payne/485071), Norton OB/GYN Associates. 2355 Poplar Level Road. Suite 304. Louisville, Kentucky 40217 Phone Number: 502-636-4946. Procedure: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy, Age: 22, Marital Status: Single, but in a long-term relationship.  Childfree Status: No children. Dr. Payne walked into the room said "Hello - I'm not here to change your mind, but I have to ensure that you are aware of all the contraceptive options, the risks and the procedure itself." He did not make me feel crazy for being a 22-year-old unmarried woman wanted sterilization. No bingoes

[Dr. Monica Brown](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Monica+A+Brown/467610) - OBGYN at Norton's Associates in Obstetrics & Gynecology. She completed a bilateral salpingectomy on me in January 2021. At the time of consult and procedure I was 25yrs old, single, no children. Time between consult and procedure was roughly 2 months. I faced no bingos during the process and felt completely supported by her and her staff. She accepted my decision and only reviewed contraception methods as necessary for informed consent. I didn't have to "convince" her or use any of the material I'd prepared to justify my request. She provided thorough information and pictures at my request. I'm in a polyamorous relationship and my support partner during the procedure was non-binary, we both felt welcome and were treated with respect. I used Anthem BCBS shield insurance and for the entire process I only paid $9.47 out of pocket.

[Dr. Shannon O'Brien](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Shannon+Collie+O%27Brien/517905) completed a bilateral salpingectomy & IUD removal yesterday at Norton Hospital in Louisville KY. I'm a 26 year old female, martial status is single but I'm in a long term relationship, no children of my own or otherwise. No bingos, just asked if I was certain I didn't want kids & approved me for surgery at our first visit. Surgery was scheduled for 5 weeks later. Time in hospital was just under 5 hours, surgery was smooth. I have Aetna and believe my cost will just be my $500 deductible.

Dr. Kathryn Modlinski with Norton Hospital in Louisville, KY who performed by tubal ligation. She even fully took them out instead of just cutting them. I'm a 27 unmarried childfree female. She didn't question me or push me against it, but had to give me the typical speech about other possibilities which I declined.

[Dr Tanika Taylor](https://allwomenobgyn.com/about/meet-the-doctors/tanika-taylor-m-d-all-women-ob-gyn-louisville-ky/). Fallopian tubes removal. 29, single (long term partner of 10 years) no children. I’ve never wanted children and have been to dr Taylor for about 10 years now. Ive been on birth control pill for those 10 years. Last year she said “every year you tell me you don’t want children, have you ever thought about a birth control more permanent? Like an IUD or even tubes tied?” I never wanted to do an iud because I’ve heard many horror stories but I was so surprised when she mentioned getting my tubes tied because I didn’t think that would be a possibility for me since I’ve never had children. I thought about it for a year and when I came back the next year (last month) I told her I wanted to go forward with getting my tubes tied. She gave me the three options (tubal clamping, burning, or complete removal) I went with the removal and luckily my insurance covered it completely- she did warn sometimes insurance push back on the removal and don’t want to cover it. She asked when she wanted to schedule the surgery and I had it scheduled for a month later. NB this doctor may not be willing to sterilise new patients. 

**London**

London Women's Center.  No questions asked other than if I was sure I didn't want children, easy to get an appointment, everyone is very kind and helpful, accepts a wide range of insurance. Was 22 at the time of approval.

**Murray** 

[Dr Matt Price](https://www.murrayhospital.org/providers/matt-price/) performs bilateral salpingectomy. I was 24 but with a long-term partner. I was simply asked if this is what I really wanted and then my procedure was scheduled for less than one month later. The doctor wanted to just clip my tubes, but I requested a full removal and he was ok with performing that.

**Owensboro** 

Daniel Warburton, he is very friendly and extremely laid back and comfortable to be around. my husband is 18, and he agreed to a vasectomy immediately, and said that each person should have a right to their own autonomy. he allowed us to schedule an appointment immediately ( on the first visit after maybe 5 minutes and answering any questions ) he also let us know that with NO insurance the charge is $750. but with insurance it varies and will likely be extremely extremely reduced.

**Prestonburg** 

[Jessica Branham, DO.](https://www.arh.org/jessica-branham-d-o/) This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am a OB/GYN in Prestonsburg, KY and I will perform tubal ligations and tubal removal surgery for any patient over 21 regardless if they have ever have had children before if they request it."

**Richmond** 

[Richmond Women's Health Care](http://rwhcky.com/) - Admittedly an Obstetrics/pregnancy-centric office, but they were very respectful of my decision to be sterilized with no bingoes, insulting questions, etc. though I'm childless and 29. Also fairly quick and easy to get an appointment.

**Somerset** 

[Dr Tolulope Fatokun](http://www.womenscarelakecumberland.com/). F/24, in a relationship but not married, Childfree. Easier than expected, my regular gyno referred me to Fatokun and in less than 2 months from my initial visit with her, I had a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. It was entirely covered at Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital with my insurance (Aetna Better Health of KY - Medicaid). Heavy on bingos but ultimately respected my decision. I had to sign a consent agreement/contract that I wouldn’t change my mind and sue. A friend of mine had the same procedure with her months later with the same experience. Overall, surgery went well and I am very pleased with how everything went, and I was back to work in less than a week with little-to-no pain during the entire recovery process.

-1 Dr Pearson, October 2018: One of our subscribers reported that the doctor was slightly bingo-ing her - questions akin to "are you sure, many women regret it, you might change your mind when you’re older, let’s discuss other forms of birth control, I don’t like performing this on anyone under 30 (I was 22 in October and am now 23), etc." a second appointment 6 months later to revisit the topic was scheduled though; but please keep this experience in mind.]

**Bossier City** 

Dr. Scott Robertson, MD Performed a tubal ligation and uterine ablation of a 25 y/o woman.

She said my insurance should cover it and had my preauth taken care of quickly. Excellent experience. Use with CAUTION if under 30 as OP is 35+ and this may have affected the doctor's decision.

**Monroe** 

[Amber Shemwell](https://www.thewomansclinic.net/#Providers) - Did my and my best friend's (25, childfree) bisalp and hysterectomy. Was willing to do other procedures such as ablation. While she is a Christian Mom, she did not judge nor question either of us. I began going into the spiel of why I wanted to be sterilized and she said I don't have to defend my choice, as long as I've done the thinking and chosen the path, she will side with me.

[Dr Adrienne Williams](https://www.medicinenet.com/doctors/ad27a081-7ca7-4984-896b-047b5b77be9e/adrienne-williams/monroe-la_doctor.htm#officeinfo), I had my tubes tied last year by Doctor Adrienne Williams at the St. Francis Women's Clinic in Monroe, Louisiana. I was 24 at the time, unmarried, and have never been pregnant. She has been my gynecologist for several years and performed the surgery herself. When I explained my total conviction in being childfree and my reasons for that decision, the only question she asked is if I was sure. We scheduled my pre-op exams that day, and I had my surgery less than two months later.

**New Orleans** 

[Dr. Marguerite Sandow, MD](https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/marguerite-sandow), Bilateral Salpingectomy - 29/single, never been pregnant nor do I have/want children. Great experience, first consult Dr. Sandow did cite the study about women under thirty experiencing the most regret and that this procedure is permanent; this was delivered to me as ‘for liability reasons I have to say these things’, not a bingo. No bingos from anyone else on my care team either. Consult to surgery was about 7 weeks, could have been sooner but I was traveling. Pre-op 1 week before, I thanked her for committing to the surgery for me as a patient under 30/single/never had children, she said absolutely & my fertility is not her decision to make.

We are happy to provide any needed Gyn care pre or post transition for any person.

I accept all major insurances and Medicaid, but out of state Medicaid or Blue Cross Blue Shield are difficult to get surgical coverage for.

I'm 31, got approved and had bilateral salpingectomy done within 3 months. I was allowed to set up a surgery date the next day if I wanted but due to covid restrictions and Mardi gras we moved the date out a bit. I went in to get a pap and ask about sterilization surgery. She was very polite and willing to do what I wanted, she practices patient first healthcare. We discussed other birth control options briefly but agreed on the spot to set up a date for surgery. She made sure I knew it was permanent and looked at my insurance and that was it. Insanely easy, she might be more hesitant for women in their early 20s because the idea of regret but I think if you're adamant enough she won't push back at all. Overall an amazing experience and I hope others will be able to see her.

+1 Dr Kao is a fantastic GYN who performed my bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 27, unmarried, 0 kids. Though she did mention I am young she was 100% supportive of my right to make my own medical decisions. I had a consult in May 2022, two follow ups (one just to sign the surgical consent) and had my surgery performed that November. Her incisions were clean and are healing up great!

[Danielle M Salhany DO](https://www.midcoasthealth.com/salhany), this gynecologist has reached out to advise, "I am an OB/ GYN in Brunswick ME and hoping to be added to any list that supports ALL reproductive choice for women"

+1 Dr Salhany, the whole start to finish this past month until yesterday I was always validated, heard, understood, felt SO safe and secure! 1000% reccomend her! Never once bingo'd at 25 years old, unmarried, childfree. Very easy process. Just said I never wanted kids and that was that! I got the referral to them (Midcoast Hospital) through Bangor, Maine at the Mable Wadsworth Centre.

[Dr. Stephanie Grohs](http://www.midcoasthealth.com/grohs), Midcoast Women's Health located at Midcoast Hospital.  (207) 721-8700- She is also a surgeon and the surgery is done by her at Midcoast Hospital.  Makes sure you are informed as to all of your options.  Respectful of your choice, even if she may not agree.  Made me wait until I was 25 before preforming surgery for her own "peace of mind" since I was young, unmarried, with no children.  Dry sense of humor, but very caring.  A couple of bingos but was not rude or insistent about it.  As soon as we were agreed that sterilization was happening, she was willing to preform the surgery ASAP.

**Ellsworth**

Dr. Eugenia Kolkas, Maine Coast Memorial Hospital - #207-664-5650. She preforms the surgery, so no secondary opinions are needed, and she performs sterilizations on women with no children pretty often. No bingos, and she makes sure that you are aware of any complications. I asked for a tubal, and she recommended the bilateral salpingectomy to reduce the chance of ovarian or cervical cancer.

[Dr. Mercado](https://appointments.northernlighthealth.org/provider/Barbara+Mercado-Stallard/1901533). She's in Ellsworth, Maine, at the Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital. OBGYN (obviously). I just had my procedure today, the 8th, and I talked to her about it August 1st I believe. The only "buzzer" thing she asked was if I was aware that there are other birth control options that aren't permanent and I said yes, I want permanent, and she said ok, we can do that! Very kind woman, very professional. I'm 21, so she does it for younger people too. NB this doctor may not be queer friendly.

**Lewiston** 

[Dr Jonathan Commons](https://www.cmhc.org/provider/jonathan-commons/). 12 High Street Lewiston, Maine 04240 (207) 795-5770. 20/yo unmarried (long term relationship) with tubal ligation. I paid for 3 office visits (he required a second opinion from someone else within the practice but he was the one who approved originally) and 16$ for the pain medications afterwards. It was a very good experience.

Dr. Duval, 12 High St Suite 200, Lewiston, Maine 04240. Phone number (207) 795-5770. Dr. Duval was awesome in getting my bilateral salpingectomy done at the age of 21. I am single and childfree. I experienced no bingos, the procedure was very fast. I was only in the waiting room about 15 minutes before being called back for pre op. The surgery went smoothly a few hours after that.

**Portland**

NB Intermed may not accepting new patients with MaineCare

[Dr. Robin Noble, Intermed](https://www.intermed.com/team/robin-noble-md/). She performs the surgery. Very knowledgeable and welcoming. Received no bingos, gave a thorough explanation of complications and procedures. Recommended a bilateral salpingectomy over a tubal ligation, but was understanding that I needed to consult my insurance coverage first. In my case (age 26) she didn't require a waiting period. Plan to keep her as my regular GYN going forward. Dr Noble has also probided a bilateral salpingectomy for another member. 

[Dr Mary Lavoie](https://www.intermed.com/team/mary-lavoie-md/), Intermed 207-874-2445. I orginally saw Dr Noble from the suggestion on here, but due to extensive scaring from previous surgies I needed a surgoen with privileges at Maine Med Surgical center. Dr Lavoie is incredible! Super kind, compassionate and knowledgable. My surgery was booked and completed within 2 weeks, with zero bingoes. She is now my regular GYN too. 

[Dr. Caroline Cassling from Intermed Women's Health Portland](https://www.intermed.com/team/caroline-cassling-md/), Bilateral salpingectomy, 35 years old, married, no children. No bingos, no judgment for wanting to be sterilized. Told me about the options she offers: ligation and salpingectomy. Wanted to be sure that I understood the complications of the surgery and recovery. Answered all of my questions. Note: I had the procedure done using Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance; if you have this same carrier, save yourself the time and frustration and let the Intermed billing department verify coverage.

**Skowhegan** 

[Dr Pameela Bisram](https://www.rfgh.net/providers/obstetrics-gynecology.xhtml). Bilateral Salpingectomy, 27F at Redington Fairview General Hospital in Skowhegan, Maine USA. Phone number for her office is 207-474-7131. Every interaction I had with Dr. Bisram was so lovely. She never once bingo’d me. Her view was “it’s my body so it’s my choice.” She just said it was her job to inform me on everything the surgery entailed, risks, etc. For anyone with Mainecare interested in Dr. Bisram I’d suggest they get their PCP to start the paperwork if possible at that appointment. With Mainecare they require you to sign a form and you won’t be able to have the procedure (this also goes for getting your tubes tied) for at least 30 days because they want to make sure you have time to think about it in case you change your mind.

+1 Dr Pameela Bisram has agreed to do a bisalp on me. I have a surgerydate scheduled. I see she did one on a 27yo, I am a 23yo however. No kids, no partner, on my first ever appointment with her.

[Dr Kristin Patzkowsky](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/index.html) at John Hopkins. Bilateral salpingectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (so cervix and uterus). She did not try to dissuade me that I would regret it at all beyond mentioning while going over consent forms that due to the fact that I am young there might be a bigger chance of regret. I am 21 years old, in an open relationship and childfree. I scheduled my surgery 2 months out, it was the soonest date. With my insurance (BCBS) there was no cost for surgery and the first follow up.

[Dr. Karen Chiu Wang](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10003225/karen-wang), performs surgery for patients who want to be childfree. I'm a minimally invasive gyn surgeon based in Maryland (Johns Hopkins Hospital and Howard County General Hospital) Insurances are based on what Hopkins accepts (triaged by access services) 443-997-0400 to schedule appointments

+1 Dr Wang, no questions asked at age 31. It was implied she had also performed surgery on women in their 20's.

[Dr. Suzanne Jiloca](https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctor/dr-suzanne-marie-jiloca-md/) - Bilateral salpingectomy. Agreed to surgery on the first visit, claimed to not have age restrictions beyond legal adult (however I am in my 30s so cannot confirm if younger people would be approved or no). 

+1 Dr Jiloca, I'm 26F, was approved on my first visit with zero bingos, and I had my bi-salp 3mos later (she books up fast). From the get go, she said that it's completely my choice and she just needed to tell me the risks and explain the procedure itself.

[Dr. Adegboyega Adejana](https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/adegboyega-adejana-md-mph-53793
https://trinityobg.com) - Tubal ligation. Dr. Adejana is a man of few words and lots of action. I saw him for my very first visit, and he was alredy willing to discuss sterilization. He only told me he had to go over other birth control methods by policy before schedualing my surgery and having me sign the paperwork. I am F28, and he never questioned my age. Kind, calm, and understanding. I highly recomend him. 

[Dr. Rebecca Stone](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/rebecca-stone), and she works in the state of Maryland (in both Baltimore City and Howard County). Dr. Stone is a big proponent of removing fallopian tubes to prevent ovarian cancer. I did originally go to her colleague Dr. Margot Watson (already on the list) who was also willing to do the procedure, but she was about to be out for several months for surgery, so I was referred to Dr. Stone. She did not question my decision once, though offered several alternatives, but more in a "surgery is risky" way as opposed to a judgmental way. I had to wait 30 days (state rule) from the time of my pre-op appointment. My surgery was covered 100% as a form of contraception. I am a 28-year-old female, never married but currently in a long-term relationship, and I have no children nor any desire to ever have children.

**Bel Air**

[Daniel P Arrison MD,FACS](https://www.unitedurology.com/affiliated-providers/daniel-p-arrison-md-facs/) Chesapeake Urology Associates, 201 Plumtree Road Bel Air, MD 21015, 410-803-0089 also 251 Lewis Lane, Havre de Grace, MD 21078, 410-942-0130.

+1 Vasectomy on 43M CF.

**Bethesda** 

Walter Reed Military Medical Center - Dr. Candace Jones-Cox and Dr. Scott Endicott. I am 28 years old, married, childfree, and recently separated female Veteran. I wanted to highlight two military doctors (Tricare) who were more than willing to perform a bilateral salpingectomy with no hesitations. Dr. Endicott specifically said my husband did not need to be involved during our initial conversation. Small disclaimer that statistically regret CAN be a factor for young, childless women, but as long as I was aware, he was on board. Dr. Jones-Cox performed the procedure due to a constrained timeline where Dr. Endicott did not have openings until August. Though my husband was completely onboard, his opinion was not even considered. I had one consultation and surgery was performed a week later.

[Dr. Supriya Mishra, OBGYN](https://gwdocs.com/profile/supriya-mishra), practices out of Bethesda, Germantown (19785 Crystal Rock Drive, Suite 208, Germantown, MD 20874) and Rockville (11500 Old Georgetown Road, 1st Floor, Rockville, MD 20852). "I have done vaginal hysterectomies for patients who want bottom surgery. I am happy to help patients who are Child free. I operate at Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville. (301) 528-8444. Just ask office to schedule visit with me specifically as I share the office with 3 other OBGYN doctors." Her clinical interests include LGBTQ Health and Trans/Non-Binary Health.

+1 [Dr. Supriya Mishra](https://gwdocs.com/profile/supriya-mishra) in Bethesda, Maryland. 31yo F, single, no children: bilateral salpingectomy. I found Dr. Mishra on the childfree directory and I couldn’t recommend her more. Absolutely no hoops—she understands her patients are adults who know what they want. I never had to defend my decision. Her staff, and the hospital staff (Shady Grove Rockville) went out of their way to figure out scheduling and insurance and make the process as easy as possible. Back to walking after a day or two, a few more days for driving.

**Cheverly** 

[Dr. Henry Adegbulugbe, "Dr Addy"](https://www.umms.org/find-a-doctor/profiles/dr-henry-adegbulugbe-md-1629156955?si=capital). UM Capital Region Health Medical Group at Cheverly. I got my tubal ligation done last week by Dr. Henry Adegbulugbe at age 25. He offered to sterilize my partner instead (26M) due to ease but didn't push when I said I was sure I wanted to be the one to have it done instead. 

**Cumberland** 

[Dr. Tom Hartsuch](https://www.wmhs.com/practitioner/hartsuch-tom-a-m-d/), Western Maryland Health System OBGYN (Full Salpingectomy)
Friend (27F) stage 4 endometriosis had her operation done after one mandatory counseling/evaluation session. Doctor advised on statistics on how many women under 30 regret it later but did not push back when assured she would be fine. Friend is confident he would perform on someone getting it purely optionally.

+1 Dr Hartsuch, I wanted to make it clear that he will perform optional sterilizations. He mentioned how young I was (27) and that adoption is expensive (I'm in a queer relationship) but readily signed off on the paperwork. I do not have any children and have never been pregnant.

**Columbia** 

[Dr Langer, Columbia MD](https://www.chesapeakeurology.com/staff/kenneth-f-langer/). Did a vasectomy, no questioning of intent, only mandatory waiting period on a 26 year old. Good doc and good practice.

[Dr. Margot Watson](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/9976510/margot-watson), Signature OBGYN (Bilateral Salpingectomy)
I got my bisalp done by Dr. Watson at 24. She did a bisalp and hysterectomy on my friend who struggled with gender dysphoria who is 23. Asked me if I was sure I wanted it and I said yes, and she said okay and scheduled my surgery. Is LGBT+ friendly.

+1 Dr Watson, I recently had a full hysterectomy by Dr. Margot Watson in Columbia, Maryland. I know she is already on the list of Childfree Friendly docs, but I just wanted to add another testimonial of support for her. Met with me, asked if I for-sure did not want kids, and then we went through with a full hysterectomy. My medical reason was extreme pain from my periods, and she was incredibly helpful and supportive.

Dr Harold Wu Johns Hopkins Baltimore & Columbia Md. Laproscopic Hysterectomy including uterus, cervix, and tubes at 25 years old. No children. Not married. Suspicion of endo but no diagnosis. My reason was period irregularity and pain. Despite me being prone to surgery complications, I healed remarkably quickly. He was so so kind through the whole process and is lgbtqia friendly. First male gyn I ever felt fully safe with. Very familiar with bottom surgery too for afab. Minimal questions. Literally just said "I'm sure you've thought this through, I just want to make sure we stay safe". Works with Dr Watson above. 

[Dr. Sasha Nelson](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/sasha-nelson) as Signature OBGYN in Columbia, MD. A few other doctors there are on the list already (Dr. Margot Watson and Dr. Harold Wu) but when I scheduled my consult Dr. Watson was out of the office on medical leave for at least another 3 months and I wanted a female doctor. I am 26, never pregnant, and not in a committed relationship. I saw Dr. Nelson for a consult at the beginning of August and had my surgery done in mid October. I went in prepared with my sterilization binder but never needed to pull it out. I was asked the typical questions such as whether I had considered long acting removable contraceptives and if I knew this is not reversible, but she was very respectful the whole time. I know there are a good number of negative reviews about Signature and Howard County General Hospital, where my procedure was performed, but my experience has been nothing but positive!

Dr. Veena Choubey, Johns Hopkins Medicine, in Columbia and Odenton, MD. During my annual exam, I (33F and married) mentioned my interest in getting a bilateral salpingectomy. I had issues with hormonal birth control in the past. Notably, the Mirena IUD caused bacterial infections for me. Dr. Choubey initially asked if my husband would consider a vasectomy instead. However, after hearing about my experience with the Mirena IUD, Dr. Choubey said she would do a bilateral salpingectomy for me. She didn't judge me for my decision. She wanted to make sure that I knew for sure that I didn't want biological children. I had a great experience with Dr. Choubey. Note for members: OP is over 30 and has had complications with an IUD, and the doctor still suggested a vasectomy for OP's partner. Have bingo rebuttals ready to go. 

**Easton** 

[Dr. Christopher Runz Easton, MD](https://www.umms.org/shore/locations/smg-urology-easton). Me: 32m, divorced/single, childfree 100%, 0 kids. Vasectomy. November 2021. After considering a vasectomy for a long time I finally built up the courage to seek out a consultation. I met with Dr. Runz who was the most enthusiastic, friendly & professional person I could have asked for. He inquired my reasons for seeking the procedure. He never once pushed back, seemed unwilling or gave bingo’s. He provided pamphlet information and discussed in detail the procedure. By the end of the consultation we were booking my procedure! I couldn’t believe it! I live in a rural area that is heavily red and I went into this appointment expecting pushback but was ecstatic when I received none. Procedure day went perfectly. Everything he described in advance was what occurred. There was nothing unexpected or out of the ordinary.

**Frederick** 

[Dr. Gerrit Schipper](https://www.capitalwomenscarefrederickobgyn.com/provider/gerrit-schipper-md) is in Frederick, MD. I went in to have a discussion about a tubal ligation because of roe v. wade, and he was very polite only asked a couple questions about why I didn’t want kids, and I was able to schedule my surgical appointment during that discussion. I’ve linked his information below. I will say I am 29, so unsure if my age plays a factor in how easy it was to get my tubal ligation, but I was expecting to have to fight for this procedure, and it was very smooth.

[Dr. Albert Simmonds](https://www.smhobgyn.com/) of Simmonds, Martin, & Helmbrecht in Maryland. Bilateral Salpingectomy. At that time he performed surgery in both Frederick and Rockville. I was 35 when I requested the procedure, and was only asked if I understood it was permanent and that a vasectomy for my husband was also an option. I said I understood, and wanted to have the procedure. He had his surgical scheduler contact me in the next few days and I had surgery a few weeks later. No hassle, no judgement, no issues post-op.

**Halethorpe** 

[Dr Cynthia Clunie Cesaire, MD](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/cynthiacesaire). Location 1701 Twin Springs Rd Halethorpe, MD 21227. Bilateral salpingectomy Dr. Cesaire is my gynecologist. I asked her about the process and she immediately congratulated me for making the decision and sent the referral over to pre-op. She does not do the surgery herself.

**Hagerstown** 

[Dr. Kristina Torrence/Seader](http://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/406) (bilateral salpingectomy) Capital Women's Care. Approved at 26 with very little bingoing/pushback. 

[Dr. Anusha Bhatia](https://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/516) Capital Women's Care. Bilateral salpingectomy 30, married, 100% childfree. Surgery scheduling was easy, no bingos from doctor.

+1 Vasectomy on 43M CF.

**Leonardtown** 

[Dr. Arthur Greenwood[(https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/arthur-john-greenwood-md) in Leonardtown, MD in February 2023. Discussed risks vs benefits with me, along with long term birth control options however I had already tried pretty much all the birth control options. Relatively easy and quick consultation and had my procedure done a few weeks later. Just made sure I knew I would not be able to have children naturally and did not pressure or question me about my decision at all. I am a 28 year old female, not married and no children.

**Lutherville** 

Dr. Victoria Ann Dowling. Bilateral salpingectomy (prior insertion of Mirena and Paragard as well). 32, Married, 100% Childfree, Kaiser Permanente. Mentioned during my PAP that husband and I were considering sterilization. 6 months later scheduled an initial consultation to discuss the procedure and what to expect. No bingos except to ask politely if I was absolutely sure and understood that this was a permanent procedure. As yet it is unclear if this doctor will move directly to sterilisation and members should take this into consideration when choosing this doctor. 

+1 Victoria Dowling, MD. Location 2391 Greenspring Drive Timonium, MD 21093. The procedure completed - Bilateral salpingectomy. Referred from Dr Cesaire listed above. Dr. Dowling was my surgeon and she was also lovely. Made sure I understood what was going to happen and answered all of my questions. Kaiser did not require a co-pay. Once you get the referral you'll be scheduled for surgery in 4-6 weeks. The only thing you're out of pocket for are your pain meds. They send them ahead of time so you can pickup before surgery. My surgery was at the Lutherville Center. Although the South Baltimore center also does surgery.

**Mechanicsville**

[Dr. Krishna P. Jayaraman](http://www.jayaramanmed.com/) - Vasectomy. I called to schedule a consultation and in that same phone call the receptionist scheduled the procedure a couple weeks following the consultation. Although I am 26, I look 16 and they treated me with respect and had no problems approving me. 28227 Three Notch Road, Mechanicsville, MD 20659

**Prince Frederick**

Dr. Shafquat Meraj - Vasectomy. Does not discriminate based on age. 1015 Prince Frederick Blvd, Prince Frederick, MD 20678, (410) 535-4116

+1 Dr Meraj. Gave me a vasectomy at 21 and didn't have any reservations about my age

**Ocean City**

[Dr Christine Neto](https://www.atlanticgeneral.org/locations/atlantic-general-womens-health-west-ocean-city/), from Atlantic general health which operates in Ocean City and Berlin, Maryland as well as Selbyville, Ocean View, and Fenwick Island, Delaware. 27F, single/dating but unmarried, no kids, never married. Bilateral tubal salpingectomy (fallopian tube removal). She asked qualifying questions: why I am looking for a tubal, why I don’t want to have children, is there any chance for regret, and why contraceptives like pills or IUD isn’t an option for me. After answering she gave me a date for surgery -covered by insurance (except for copay’s) under Aetna -the anesthesiologist offered me a local block to prevent pain in my abdomen, so I had very little pain while healing

**Rockville**

[Paul Mackoul & Natalya Danilyants](https://innovativegyn.com/) Center for Innovative GYN Care - Laparoscopic hysterectomy. Trans friendly office; no issues getting hysterectomy at 24; Specialize in minimally invasive, 2 incision surgery. *Another CFer note: Just FYI: The doctors here work out of a Catholic Hospital, so my elective sterilization cost wasn't covered (23F, Double Salpingectomy). Be aware that the cost may likely be paid out of pocket.*

[Astrid von Walter Gonzalez](https://www.rockvillegynecology.com/), Rockville Gynecology. Bilateral Salpingectomy approved in my late 20's. She does talk a lot about risk of regret, but ultimately did not argue and immediately scheduled surgery. 

[Dr. Gary Friedlander](https://www.chesapeakeurology.com/staff/gary-s-friedlander/) in Rockville, MD, was very thorough with how he would proceed with the surgery, and did not oppose or question me when I mentioned I had no children. He simply mentioned to make sure this is what I wanted and proceeded to get the surgery booked during my consultation. My vasectomy went with mo issues, and my recovery was very easy with no issues.

[Dr. George Resta](https://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/126), bilateral salpingectomy - I'm 28, married, and do not have any children. He gave me information about the procedure and some basic statistics about regret, but never once questioned my decision and made it very clear he supported me. It took me 3-4 weeks to get my consult, and then they could have scheduled me for the procedure in less than a month, but I had to wait a little longer because of scheduling conflicts. My insurance (United Healthcare Oxford) has said that everything will be covered, but I have yet to receive the bills. 

**Salisbury** 

Dr. Monique Williams, Chesapeake Healthcare in Salisbury, MD. Performed a bisalp on 21 y/o female, single and no kids. Was super kind and scheduled me quickly.

**Silver Spring**

[Dr. Ein](http://www.cwcare.net), Capitol Women's Care - Essure. NB while it is unlikely this doctor will provide Essure, Dr Ein may still be childfree/sterilisation friendly. 

[Dr. Nancy Behram](http://obgynsilverspring.com/drnancybehram.htm), OB/GYN Associates - Essure, Novasure. NB while it is unlikely this doctor will provide Essure, Dr Behram may still be childfree/sterilisation friendly.

[Dr. Bradford Kleinman](http://obgynsilverspring.com/drbradforkleinman.htm) - Adiana. NB while it is unlikely this doctor will provide Adiana, Dr Kleinman may still be childfree/sterilisation friendly.

[Dr. Nicole DeQuattro M.D., FACOG](https://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/83) - (laprascopic bilateral salpingectomy). I’m 27 and single and she performed this procedure little issue. She pushed back a little in initial appointment but was it just quick “are you sure?” questions; seemed more like she was covering her bases than trying to change my mind. Had a follow-up appointment where she described the procedure and third appointment was the surgery.

**Silver Spring/Rockville**

[Dr. Anne Shrout](http://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/155), Capitol Women's Care (laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy). I had to get a letter from my psychiatrist and have a close friend or family member come in and tell my doc that yes, this really was a thing I had thought through and wanted.

-1 Dr. Shrout refused sterilization to a 22-year old woman who had a letter of support from her psychiatrist, and the supportive presence of her mother. Dr. Shrout treated the person like a child, told her she would meet someone who would change her mind about having children, told her that her psychiatrist-prescribed medication was affecting her thinking, and she might think different when she eventually came off it.

[Dr. Andrew Block](http://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/415) - Bilateral Salpingectomy. NOTE: May be reluctant to approve women in their early 20's, I was approved at 27. Contemporary OB/GYN Associates - (301)468-0073

**Towson** 

[Dr. Susie Chung](https://www.susienchungmd.com/) in Towson, Maryland. It was right after Essure came to market. I thought about it, and couldn't come up with a reason not to get sterilized. I did a search on the website, as not many places do it and found her. I had never met her before, and went in for the purpose of sterilization. I opened with, this is what I want, and I am happy to hear any medical reasons no. We discussed it in detail, and she didn't treat me with skepticism. She also diagnosed me with Menorrhagia, and helped me get an insurance covered ablation afterwards. I've never had low iron since! While Essure is unfortunately defunct, I believe this is the fault of the company that didn't properly do research beforehand. She always stayed up with what was current when I had her, and I'm sure she would still perform procedures with ease now. 

**Westminster**

[Dr. Keith O'Reilly MD](https://www.chesapeakeurology.com/locations/westminster/), Urologist - Vasectomy - No scalpel, titanium clamps, length of vas deferens removed, cauterized both ends of both vas deferens.

**Andover**

Dr. Stephen Zappala, MD, Andover Urology, 140 Haverhill St, Andover, MA 01810 (978) 475-4499. April 2023. Vasectomy on 28-year-old CF redditor.

**Beverly**

[David DiChiara](https://physicians.lahey.org/details/137/david-dichiara-gynecology-beverly-danvers) - Essex County OBGYN, David DiChiara, 83 Herrick St Suite 3002, Beverly, MA 01915 (978) 927-4800. Dr. DiChiara prefers his patients to be over 30 for sterilization. He's been mostly doing bisalps.

**Boston** 

[Dr. Trevin Lau, MD]( https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/18504/trevin-pronounced-tre-veen-lau) : Mass General Obstetrics and Gynecology, 55 Fruit St., Yawkey Center for Outpatient Care, Suite 4F, Boston, MA 02114, 617-724-2229. Also in Waltham. Dec 2022, Bisalp on 33-year-old redditor. She works at Massachusetts General Hospital. She works out of the Boston campus of Massachusetts General Hospital, but performs the procedure at the campus in Waltham, MA. Her only concern was me going through an elective surgery when my IUD works just fine but I mentioned the political climate and she said okay. She had no moral objection to it; just wanted to make sure. No bingos at all. So we scheduled it for two months out. She was fine with  me keeping my IUD for period control.

-1 Dr Lau, "she just kept suggesting an IUD (even when I told her repeatedly that I was adamantly opposed to one due to trauma/anxiety) and told me 3 times that I might regret sterilization."

[Dr. Carrie Coleman](https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17673/carrie-coleman) Obstetrician/Gynecologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. For me she did a bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy (taking out the fallopian tubes). She was very sweet and curteous and supportive of my decision, she didn't push me on why I wanted to be childfree, she only asked the three legal questions of am I sure, am I sure I want surgery, and am I aware of the surgery risks. She was a joy to work with and the entire procedure from consult to surgery was only a month. Everyone in the department was very nice as well. If you need more information please let me know.

-1 Dr Coleman, her receptionist was either being difficult or was incompetent so I never got an appointment despite calling 3+ times

Dr. Dale K Weldon at the Faulkner Hospital in Boston MA - she will perform any sterilization with 2 requirements: you must be a legal adult and you must consent to the procedure. I was not bingoed by this doctor. She didn't try to convince me to change my mind (25yo). When I told her I wanted a hysterectomy, she didn't hesitate. Since I have endometriosis I was asked to have a laprascopy beforehand to figure out what type of hysterectomy to give me, but she will perform any sterilization procedure on anyone who wants one.

-1 Dr Weldon, refused a hysterectomy for a 23yo who is using hormonal birth control to manage heavy bleeding/long periods. 

Beth Israel Hospital 330 Brookline Ave Boston MA 02215. The entire OBGYN department was extremely supportive in my decision. I brought up the topic of sterilization during my routine OBGYN appointment with Dr Cory French (sometime late fall) had a pre op appointment about a month later and then had my surgery the following April. The surgery went perfect and the staff at the hospital were amazing. The surgery was preformed by Dr Royce and Dr Trochtenberg I couldn’t have asked for a better team as were absolutely phenomenal. If you are in the Boston area I would highly recommend them. 

Dr. Tiffany Minors at Beth Israel saw me today and was wonderful and listened to my history and reasons, and didn't make me feel like I had to justify not wanting children. We talked about all options available, and she accepted my concerns about temporary birth control without judgement. She set me up for a confirmation to go through with surgery, informed me of risks and clearly went through the surgery without fear mongering. She acknowledged that I have felt this way for quite a long time, and that I've clearly thought carefully about this. She made me feel seen, and like a person, and the whole department was incredible and kind. While doctors may come and go and I have yet to meet my surgeon, the OBYGYN department of this hospital is very good for affirming personal choice, and I was given no pushback for my wishes. I know I'm being correctly informed and helped with my options, and feel incredibly safe and understood with this. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Minors to anyone looking to start this journey.

Dr. Roncari was unavailable because of an emergency surgery, so I saw Dr. Thieu. She wanted to keep me on the IUD but I persisted that it was causing problems and wasn't working for me, so she OK'ed an Essure procedure. Was 28 at the time.

+1 Dr Matta, Brighton, MA. I am 36/f, partnered, and got a bisalp + unilateral oophorectomy (I was having left side ovulation pain) last week. She also inserted a new IUD as I am one of the fortunate folks who get 0 periods with Mirena, so she was willing to give me a new one still to stop bleeding for the next 8 years :)

**Brookline** 

[Dr. Sarah Miller, MD MPH](https://www.northeastvasectomy.com/), Northeast Vasectomy and Family Planning PLLC. 1180 Beacon St, Brookline, MA 02446. No scalpel vasectomy. 29 male, single, childless. One consult and same day vasectomy appointment, one post-vasectomy appointment. Verified that I understood the procedure and that it is permanent. Respectful and easy process. Accepts insurance (ended up being no cost to me). 10/10 would get snipped again.

[Ashley Ackerman / Commonwealth OB-GYN](https://www.commobgyn.com/?utm_source=gmb_auth). Bilateral salpingectomy. 26, single, voluntarily sterilized. Very short wait time. 2 weeks' wait for consult. Surgery scheduled for 3 weeks later. Completely covered by insurance (and not subject to deductible) with UnitedHealthcare Choice - Harvard Pilgrim [Pending]. No bingos, though doctor did mention the statistics for the possibility of regret being higher for patients under 30. She was thorough in describing the risks of the procedure, but didn't try to talk me out of it. She stressed her belief in bodily autonomy.

**Burlington**

Dr. William Faust, MD (781.744.8420) Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center 41 Mall Road Burlington, MA  01805. 
(Vasectomy) I went in for a vasectomy consultation, asked me a few questions, asked how many children I had, I started giving my prepared speech about how I'm childfree and I've been with my wife for 10+ years and I got about half way through and he stopped me and said he understood that some people don't want children, he wasn't there to judge. Scheduled my vasectomy for a few months out. Got it a few weeks ago. While he was preparing for the surgery, he was making small talk, and again asked how many children I have, when I told him 0, he was like, "oh yeah, that's right" and we continued on with the conversation as if nothing happened. Very nice and relaxed.

[Dr Ambareen Jan](https://physicians.lahey.org/details/3756/ambareen-jan-gynecology-burlington-peabody) Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, 41 Mall Road, Burlington, MA 01805, (781) 744-8560 or Lahey Medical Center, Peabody, One Essex Center Drive, Peabody, MA  01960, (978) 538-4620. I am a 24(F) with no children and got a BiSalp from her recently. I met up with her 2 months out to discuss my thoughts and views. She made sure it was something I thoroughly understood and discussed what the procedure would consist of. She approved me me right away since I knew what I wanted and she had amazing bed side manners beginning to end! Dr. Jan is all for women being in control of their bodies. The whole team at Lahey was warm and welcoming throughout the whole process, 100% recommend! 

+1 Dr. Jan, March 2023. Bisalp on childfree 26-year-old redditor. Waited about two weeks to see her, and was approved at the initial consultation for the surgery. She asked some basic questions but nothing I would consider bingo, very empowering. Surgery scheduled a month and a half later- easy no bingo pre-op with another physician. Actual surgery went great, my care team was fantastic. Lahey is a teaching hospital so there’s a lot of folks in the room but everyone was respectful. I have a severe phobia of needles. Both my nurse and my anesthesiologist took that seriously and I was listened to. She knows she’s on this list and has been contacted by other redditors, but she seems pretty chill about it.

**Cambridge** 

Germaine Earle Cruickshanks, D.O., Mount Auburn Hospital (617) 503-1000. Bilateral salpingectomy. Agreed to start the process towards surgery after our first appointment. Was comfortable with marijuana use. 

[Dr. Michele Finkle](https://www.mountauburnhospital.org/find-a-provider/profile/michele-finkle/), Mount Auburn Practice for Women at Fresh Pond 725 Concord Avenue Suite 1200 Cambridge, MA 02138. I’m 34F, not married but in a LTR with a man, and neither of us have ever really wanted children. Dr. Finkle didn’t push back on my request at all, no bingos, she explained everything, answered all my questions. Overall, totally respectful and just lovely to work with. I highly recommend her, and honestly the Mount Auburn Practice for Women in general. Every time I’ve been there (for this and other things) they’ve been wonderful, from the front desk staff to the clinicians and everyone in between.

**Chestnut Hill**

Abigail R. Burns, M.D., Brigham & Womens Faulkner Hospital (617) 731-3400. 200 Boylston St Ste 301 Chestnut Hill, MA 02476. Scheduled Surgery right after consultation. Bi Salp for an unwed 27F with no kids, very agreeable if you can provide a history of wanting this and that you have done your research. 

**Chicopee** 

[Lee Marin Appelbaum, DO](https://www.trinityhealthofne.org/provider/lee-m-appelbaum-do-obstetrics-gynecology). 444 Montgomery Street, Chicopee, Massachusetts 01020. She performed a full hysterectomy, removing the uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes, but leaving the ovaries. I was 29 and married at the time with no kids, but my spouse was not consulted about their opinion on the matter. She was honestly absolutely fantastic about the whole thing. We decided in the first visit that that's what would be done. I got it done for medical and gender reasons, but she was not against doing it for birth control (just warned my insurance would not cover it for that reason). My insurance fully covered it (Masshealth) and she was fantastic throughout, very supportive and affirming of my decision. Only double checked once that I would not regret my decision, but believed me when I said I would not. The office staff is absolutely horrendous, but she's worth it.

**Fall River** 

[Dr. Stephen Gagliardi](https://www.myobassociates.com/dr-gagliardi/) I had a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy I am 26f, unmarried but in a stable 4 year relationship. 0 children My OB practices in his office, he isn't my main doctor, but when I met with him for my consult I was there for 5 minutes max. He asked a few of the typical "what if your partner wants kids, what if you change your mind" but took my answers at face value. This doctor is VERY blunt and won't coddle you.

[Ericka M. Hersh](https://southcoastwoman.com/) at Southcoast Woman's Care in Fall River, MA; performed bilateral salpingectomy on a single, 24 year old female. I saw her for the first time in April and I asked her to be steriled. She supported my decision right away and suggested the bilateral salpingectomy since it can also help prevent cancer. Procedure occured a couple months later in August.

[Dr. Susanne Matais-Gomes](https://www.truesdalehealth.com/physician/susanne-matias-gomes-d-o/) Bisalp completed Married - 35 - Childfree.

**Gardner** 

Dr. Andrea M. Damour, MD at Heywood Hospital in Gardner, Massachusetts. I had been inquiring about sterilization 9 years ago but decided to go for an iud instead. This year I again stated my desire for sterilization and Dr. Damour agrees to perform the surgery. She did site potential regret on the paperwork but was very transparent about doing that during the whole process.

**Greenfield** 

[Dr. Polonsky and Dr Hebert](https://www.baystatehealth.org/services/telehealth?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=brandify&utm_content=telehealth), 48 Sanderson St, Greenfield Massachusetts 01301, 413 773 2200. Performed a bisalp/ablation, then a year later a full hysterectomy because of breakthrough bleeding/associated pain and issues. 22 for bisalp, 23 for hysterectomy. Process for bisalp: called, had a phone appointment where they asked questions about if I was interested in birth control, I said I wanted to control/stop my bad periods and also never get pregnant. They tried recommending hormonal options, I said those have always gone horribly wrong, and my periods are too bad to even consider a copper IUD. She said they have "more permanent surgical options, but they'll leave you unable to have children" and I said I was interested in pursuing because I never want children. She asked me to explain my logic, I said I've never wanted kids, and if I changed my mind, I would never want biological ones and would adopt due to some family medical stuff. She approved me pending a physical exam in person which was really more to make sure I was who I said I was and to make sure everything was in the right place. Surgery was a few months later and could have been sooner except it didn't fit my schedule well. Extremely smooth process and only pushback was them trying to make sure they didn't do a surgery if they didn't have to.

Cost is 250 insurance copay for surgery. Very kind and understanding.

-1 Dr. Bond "When I got there I heard the receptionists loudly speaking with each other about me and how ridiculous I am for getting a tubal ligation at my age, insinuating that I only want to have unprotected sex and that I will change my mind. There were other patients within earshot. The receptionist then told me Dr. Bond had to reschedule, and that I should just give up because I am too young to have the procedure done.“

[Dr. Ruth Pryor](https://www.cooleydickinson.org/doctors-providers/ruth-pryor-md/) She performed a bilateral salpingectomy for me at age 26. She seems very proreproductive rights, provided that you know what you want in life and seem sure. She also mentioned that the office she operates out of (Cooley Dickinson Medical Group ObGyn and Midwifery) does not have an "age limit" for such procedures, and that any doctor there would perform the procedure.

Bisalp on 25 year old redditor. I went into my appointment at age 24 concerned but prepped to fight for a bisalp.

She does telehealth and non-surgical appointments from the Boston, Massachusetts location and did the bisalp procedure at the Mass General location in Waltham, Massachusetts. I explained that I wanted a bisalp, that although I had Mirena IUDs for years, I was concerned with the fall of Roe, even in “safe” Massachusetts. She said she had no problem doing the surgery but did reiterate that this was permanent, that I could only ever biological children through IVF if I chose (and wouldn’t be covered by insurance). I said I understood and that I haven’t wanted kids since I was 12. Excellent work by doctors. Waiting on bill from insurance. I believe it’s $300 for the outpatient fee (and I had a $45 copay for the telehealth call) but I don’t expect more bills (Tufts Health Plan). I met my deductible so shouldn’t be too bad. 33, single, never married, no children

[Vanessa K. Dalton, MD.](http://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/340/vanessa-k-dalton-md). University of Michigan Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital. Gave me a tubal ligation (I was 24) and didn't give me much hassle except to confirm my reasons because she doesn't want to be sued by someone changing their mind. The surgery and recovery went well and scarring is barely noticeable.

-1 Dr Dalton: She agreed to perform a tubal ligation via cauterization on me at 22. She was unwilling to do a bilateral salpingectomy because I might change my mind, but agreed that if I came back in a few years she'd do it, in addition to the tubal now.

[Melina Dendrinos, University of Michigan](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/32483/melina-lorann-dendrinos-md). Bilateral salpingectomy 27, partnered, childfree, queer. Approved a bisalp at my second appointment. I originally came in for pelvic pain and she recommended a laparoscopy to check for endometriosis. Because the recovery period for that is only a week and my work doesn't do short term disability for anything under 2 weeks, I asked if we could do a bisalp at the same time. She was all for it! Asked the required questions to make sure I knew it was permanent, and within minutes approved it and told me to expect a call to schedule--they scheduled about 3 months out. No issues with BCBS insurance and U of M doesn't expect payment up front. At the surgery all the medical professionals were highly professional and I didn't get any comments on my choice. I was shocked at how easy the experience was.

Dr. Bell confirmed that I understood it was a permanent solution and that IVF would be required if I should ever want to become pregnant, and had no objections to performing the surgery.  Dr. Versha Pleasant said she believes strongly that women should know about all forms of birth control and are the ultimate arbiters of their bodies.

I’m 27F, no kids & unmarried. I had a bilateral salpingectomy. Dr Burns was very kind, he told me it was my choice and not once did he bingo me in anyway. Because he was out getting knee surgery, I had my procedure done by Dr Erin Swor, who reiterated it was my choice and only informed me that if I chose to have children in the future I would need IVF. I had my procedure done almost one month to the day of my first appointment with Dr Burns. 10/10 would recommend

[Dr. Erin Swor, MD](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/34021/erin-colleen-swor-md). Bilateral salpingectomy. 22F, childfree with long term partner. Dr. Swor is incredible! I brought up sterilization at my first appointment with her and she did not once bingo me despite my age. She only made sure I was aware that a bisalp is a permanent procedure with no reversal available. From my experience, Dr. Swor seems to really value bodily autonomy and I highly recommend her to any young women wanting to be sterilized.

[Dr. K. Zdrada](https://ihacares.com/providers/mi/ann-arbor/katie-zdrada-md), Da Vinci Laparoscopic Supra-cervical hysterectomy with bi-salp, single, F 29, childfree. I had massive fibroids/uterine bulk and was referred to Dr. Z by her partner (Dr. Megan Bogosh). The consultation wait was about a month and a 10 day wait from consultation to surgery day (per my request). Dr. Zdrada didn’t bingo me or try to talk me into a different surgery, she told me I was old enough to know what I wanted. 5/5 experience: kept my cervix per my request, no bingos from any of the staff, small incisions, great anesthesiologist team and post surgical-pain management.

[Dr. Jeffrey C. Custer](http://jeffreycuster.md.com/offices) 181 W Emmett St, Battle Creek, MI 49037 (269) 965-8866 
Asks for an initial consultation appointment, then at least a 30-day wait before surgery.

Dr. Collins, Grace Health. I’m 21 years old, single, no children. I just got my bilateral salphingectomy yesterday, yay. From the consult to surgery day was less than 40 days. Doctor was extremely nice and understanding. I would recommend anyone looking for sterilization to go to him.

[Mahmood Siddiqui, MD Battle Creek, Michigan. Calhoun county](https://www.bronsonhealth.com/doctors/mahmood-siddiqui/). I was sent to him after my last dr had left the practice. He asked me my reasons for sterilization, made sure I knew 110% that it was permanent. Upon hearing that I have a spouse he was curious to know my s/o’s opinion (fine w it) and was a-ok with doing the surgery. Tho I worry if my s/o would have had a negative opinion it would have been denied) - overall a great experience.

Dr. McFarland is one of two doctors in this office that can do the surgery. The other doctor is a male. I had to write a letter explaining why I wanted the surgery over other birth control methods.

[Edward Merkel, MD](https://ihacares.com/providers/mi/canton/edward-merkel-md). Approved for tubal ligation at age 22 as a childfree individual. This doctor is trans friendly and gender affirming. We are currently waiting on confirmation that the doctor has completed sterilisation. 

[Kotha, Vijay M.D.](https://www.urologist.org/new/), Vasectomy, 30 yr old, Separated, childfree. No Bingo's. very straight forward. only telling me the things he needed to. The office askes for a 250$ deposit. If the procedure is covered fully from insurance you can get it back.

**Chesterfield** 

[Dr. Stephen Olson](https://www.mclaren.org/main/physician-directory/olson-stephen-1788), didn’t care about my marital status, he just wanted me to understand it was permanent and make sure that’s what I wanted. He performed a bilateral salpingectomy and uterine ablation on me. Pt was approved at 23 but couldn't have the surgery until 26 due to Covid.

[Dr. Ida Lippincott MD, OBGYN]( https://doctors.beaumont.org/provider/Ida+Afshar+Lippincott/224960) Generations OBGYN, 35046 Woodward Ave #100, Birmingham, MI 48009, 248-647-9860. Sterilized 36 year old CF, who had been her patient for about 2 years. “During our first appointment, she saw I listed PCOS in my history and asked if I wanted kids. I said no, she said "great, that makes my job easier!" Never questioned me, accepted this immediately. I broached sterilization later, but had an IUD I was willing to take to the end of its life when I first went to her. The day I called to ask about it, her office scheduled the appointment without hesitation.… the impression I got was that she was working hard to provide care because she does support bodily autonomy.” Doctor is sex-positive, and did not care that the patient’s partner had a vasectomy. 

[Rebecca Ann Jameson](https://www.waynehealthcares.org/find-a-provider/rebecca-jameson-1750769444/), this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am a CF doc who performs sterilizations for CF AFAB and would really like to be included on your list. As a recent example, had a 25 year old for which I did bilateral salpingectomy. Have done for a wide range of ages and am not interested in partner status. I was recently added to the childfree sterilization Facebook page and am hoping to get the word out that there are options in Detroit. My offices are in Detroit and Southfield, Michigan. I am the Ryan Program Director for the residency which means that I am in charge of teaching our resident physicians about abortion, sterilization, and contraception."

+1 Dr. Jameson. Bisalp on 21-year-old redditor. I asked my doctor at my first appointment if there would be any issues since im unmarried, and she said that since I am an adult I can freely make my own medical decisions. At the hospital, not once was I judged, treated condescendingly, or asked if I was "sure" i wanted this procedure, and everything went smoothly.

This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "board certified and personally childfree OB/Gyn here! Working in East Lansing MI and St John’s MI. I’m so happy to help however I can. Come see me."

[Dr. Kevin London](https://www.alliance-obgyn.com/kevin-london/). Bilateral salpingectomy. I am 26/female/single never married/in good overall health. He explained all the risks and benefits of a bisalp, then he asked me for my thoughts as to why I wanted it performed. I told him I knew from a very young age that I didn't want kids and that was all I had to say. He literally said "You don't have to beg, I support you!". He did say that if I had been 18 or 19 and asking for sterilization, he would've had a more difficult time approving the surgery, but he said he's done this on patients as young as 22. The procedure went smoothly. It was performed at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing. The nurses and doctors were incredible. Dr. London met with me before I was wheeled into the OR to answer any last-minute questions I had. All it took was three tiny incisions and he closed the wounds with Dermabond, which is basically just surgical glue so I don’t have to deal with any stitches. The office called me the day after to see how I was doing and then I have a post-op appointment in a couple of weeks. It was only a month between my consultation and my surgery! I highly recommend Dr. London, he’s so compassionate and you can tell he truly cares for his patients.

Dr. Renee Stevens at Alliance OB-GYN. She performed my total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy and cystoscopy on 2/7/22, and I can't say enough good things about her. She's a wonderful doctor with amazing bedside manner, and although I prepared a long list of reasons, she didn't expect me to justify my rationale for wanting to be childfree and not wanting to deal with painful and debilitating period symptoms. She's an amazing advocate for her patients and empowering them to choose what's best for themselves, while educating them about risks associated with surgery, appropriate postoperative career, etc. We discussed whether just a bisalp or a hysterectomy would be best for me, and she helped me reach the decision that was best for myself.

Dr. Jessica Frost with Alliance Obgyn. I’m a 29F, married, with no kids. At our initial consult, she listened to me without pushing back or questioning my decision (or asking if my husband approved). She answered all of my (and my husband’s) questions at the initial consult, pre-op, and bedside before the operation. She was thoughtful, warm, kind, and seemed genuinely happy to be performing the surgery for me. I cannot rave about her enough!

Dr Stephanie Flemings in East Lansing, Michigan from Alliance Obgyn who agreed to put me through a salpingectomy no questions asked! I’m a 22 y/o female with no children.

Dr. Sakina Hakim - Dr. Hakim made things as easy as possible. I met with her one time and the only concerns she had was how long I knew I wanted to be childfree. When she learned it was since my teens, she immediately agreed to do a procedure and it was my choice between having the tubes taken out, tied or Essure. I was 30 years old and divorced at the time.

-1 Dr Hakim: 19yo had an "unpleasant and dismissive experience with her", where Dr Hakim made OP cry and refused to perform a tubal ligation. Dr Hakim "also told me birth control is what my focus should be, even after I told her my geneticist strongly recommends against it."

+1 Dr. Hakim was willing to preform a bilateral salpingectomy on me at 19 after having me write a paper on why i wanted the procedure and meeting with Dr. Eisenberg as well. Surgery was scheduled for a month later. 

Dr. Andrea Eisenberg at Michigan Women's Health is also cf-friendly. She didn't bingo me, only asked reasonable questions. I went to my appt very prepared. She was a bit hesitant, but I was 23 and single at the time, and it was my first time seeing her. I had a very quick, easy, smooth recovery from surgery and everything billed correctly with insurance. Performs bilateral salpingectomy (preferred), tubal ligation (by cauterization), and Essure. Also did my friend's Essure procedure no questions asked at 34 (CF & married).

+1 Dr Eisenberg, Performed a laparoscopic bisalp (I'm 27, no children, not married). No bingos, super easy appointment. She said a lot of people are requesting sterilization since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and it was clear I'd done my research, so she trusted me. My surgery was about 1 month after my consultation. Everyone at DMC Berry Surgery Center was sweet and supportive, and I'm recovering great. Slight sore throat, no complications with anesthesia/UTIs/incisions. Still waiting on billing/insurance, but she seemed experienced and confident about billing codes. Bonus: During surgery, she kept an eye out for endometriosis/other issues.

Dr. Hamid Banooni (Michigan Women's Health) did an acquaintence's tubal ligation when she was 24 or 25 (also CF, but she had been his patient for a couple years before and consistently asked for the tubal).

**Flint** 

[Dr. Mona Hardas OBGYN](https://www.hardasobgyn.com/), 3353 Fleckentstein Drive, Flint, Michigan 48507 810-720-1790. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise they would be willing to provide sterilisation procedures for patients who desire it, provided they are 18+

Dr. Keith Heslinger, MD, with Flint OBGYN, located in Flint, MI. He agreed no questions asked other than that I realized it was permanent. He did say that he would be hesitant to do the salpingectomy on anyone under 28 due to regret levels but I'm 37 and got zero pushback on getting the procedure. He was very understanding especially with what is going on right now with Roe v. Wade. 10/10 wuld recommend.

**Gaylord** 

Dr. David Miner. All I did was ask for a tubal, and that was it. I'm 27, and he didn't ask any questions as to why, or try to talk me out of it. He just gave me the information I needed to make informed consent, had me sign the medicaid paperwork, and told me after the medicaid waiting period that I will be good to go for surgery. Hope this is able to help someone out.

**Grand Blanc:** 

Thomas C. Wright, DO, Women's Integrated Healthcare. Address: 1595 Genesys Pkwy, Grand Blanc, MI 48439. (810) 606-9190. Performs Essure procedure. I got mine at 27 with no children, made a consultation appointment, then the procedure appt. Dr. Wright did make sure several times that I knew the procedure was permanent. Had to sign something to that regard. Great doctor, has always listened to my concerns, is knowledgeable in the latest research, and explains things clearly without talking down to me. Was not rude or dismissive of my desire at any time. Did not try to talk me into a non-permanent option, but did make sure I was aware of them.
Accepts Healthy Michigan plan (a form of Medicaid)

-1 Dr Wright, will not sterilise a 22 year old. Better suited for over 25's. 

Dr. Michael Engel, DO - OB/Gyn and surgeon - Take my experience with a grain of salt because I'm 42. I don't know about success of younger women looking for sterilization. Offered me a bisalp at 38 when removing my IUD from complications, but I'd not thougth about it yet. After a few years of pill complications, I went back. He gave me no pushback, was impressed I knew the difference between a bisalp and a tubal (the paper work said tubal but he did a bisalp and that's what my insrance approval was, too). I signed paperwork that day, then again ~6 weeks later at preop appt. Had surgery this morning and everything is going great so far. He asked me how many kids I had but didn't blink an eye at none - none of the staff at the hospital even asked, which was great.

- 1 Dr Engel. Do NOT visit this doctor if under 40. Several months ago went and seen Dr Engel Grand Blanc MI to ask about sterilization, he was in network for me and a user had added him to the list but she was over 40. I am 21 now, I asked when I was 20, he said he wouldn't do it for several years because I need to try all other birth control options first, and some board of review would think he is crazy for sterilizing a "healthy 21yr old girl" even though I had a 20 page report on sterilization complete with pictures and testimonies. He didn't even look at it. I left crying.

Dr. Stacey McEwen: she has two offices under Women's Integrated Health in Davison and Grand Blanc. 1 Genesys Pkwy #1595, Grand Blanc, MI 48439 (810) 606-9190 and 1260 N Irish Rd suite c, Davison, MI 48423 (810) 653-0388. Her policy is 30+ for sterilization and she did ask me the generic are you sure? Have you tried these birth control methods? Etc but it felt like a liability coverage thing because she accepted my answers of no, I won't change my mind and I don't think that would work for my lifestyle the first time I gave them. She also is very willing to work with people who have another doctor sign off if they are under 30. Like as soon as the liability questions and signatures are over she helped me get appointments and schedule the surgery asap. I've been going to her for about 2 years and she's never been judgmental or made me feel like I'm not being listened to about my individual health. She also accepts Medicare and medicaid!

Dr. Martin Lapa from Grand Blanc Michigan. He is also located in Davison, MI. and accepts Medicaid! Also very understanding with sexual trauma. Very good man! Highly recommended. Bilateral salpingectomy 22F. 

[Dr. Jennifer Deanna](http://www.womensspecialtyassociatespc.com) at Womens Specialty Associates, Grand Blanc, Michigan. I am female, freshly 21 years old, and am not married and childfree. My partner doesn’t have children either. Doctor Deanna approved me for the procedure immediately and let me know that she will always understand and respect women’s healthcare choices. She never bingo’ed me or warned me about changing my mind. The nurses at her hospital were very sweet as well. Bisalp was performed on 5/30/2023.

**Grand Rapids:** 

[Dr. John Lobo - Urology Surgeons](https://www.urologysurgeons.com). Vasectomy performed on me, age 23, unmarried but in long term relationship, child free/no previous children. Pretty sure the entire clinic would perform one, as they let me schedule my consultation and surgery at the same time via phone. At consultation, he gave the typical “you’re young and might change your mind” speech, but assured me he just wanted to play Devils Advocate and that he wouldn’t stop me and just wanted me to really think hard about it before the procedure.

Dr. Maatman at Michigan Urological Clinic in Grand Rapids, MI. Vasectomy, 20yo. I had an incredibly positive experience and Dr. Maatman was very respectful and affirming of my childfree choice.He talked me through the procedure and did not try to dissuade me at all and was as previously mentioned quite affirming of my choice.

[Grand Rapids OB/GYN](http://grandrapidsobgyn.co): The bulk of my experience was with Nisha McKenzie, PA-C and I had my followup with Dr. Dalm. Nisha was incredible, and her team of nurses made my Essure procedure at 33 years old close to perfection.

David P. Menapace, MD. [Spectrum Health Medical Group Obstetrics and Gynecology](http://www.shmg.org/obstetricsgynecology), Grand Rapids, MI 49525. 616-267-7069. At the Beltline Ave location. Got essure. Hesitant for a 25 year old but was more concerned that I was educated on options and procedure itself, he was friendly and not judgmental

-1 Dr. Menapace would not consider doing a tubal on me as a 20 year old (and said he wouldn't do it if I were 21 either), despite saying I sounded educated on my options. He wasn't up for much discussion on it and was dismissive. I'll also add that he seemed more interested in doing the Essure procedure rather than a surgical option.

Dr. Stephanie Flermoen, M.D. Located in: Spectrum Health Medical Group Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 3800 Lake Michigan Dr NW suite a, Grand Rapids, MI 49534. Phone: (616) 267-8225. Performed a tubal ligation on a 28 year old with no children. 

Dr. Jeffrey Dood, MD. [Spectrum Health Medical Group Obstetrics & Gynecology](https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/jeffrey-dood-28fa2e08-24ed-44af-84c9-3dff9b6ddbca-overview), 4249 Parkway Place Dr SW Ste C, Grandville, MI, 49418. (616) 774-7035. For those who aren't uncomfortable with a male gynecologist, he's been great. He appreciated the research I did when I requested an IUD and was great for that procedure. When I (35, married, no kids) inquired about a tubal ligation and other sterilization options, we discussed the pros and cons of each. He reminded me that it was a permanent procedure (but commented that he figured I was already aware, per my research) and gave me no pushback regarding moving forward to scheduling it. Great experience with him!

[Dr. Suzanne West, OBGYN, FACOG](https://findadoctor.spectrumhealth.org/physician/profile/3252) Spectrum Health Medical Group Obstetrics & Gynecology 3800 Lake Michigan Dr NW, Suite A, Grand Rapids, MI 49534, 616.267.8225 - I am a transgender man and Dr. West was great to work with. She performed a total hysterectomy for me and was very knowledgeable about the LGBTQ community because she is part of it herself.  When I expressed frustration at how hard it is to get a hysterectomy, she voiced that she believes people should be in control of their own reproductive capabilities and that she will go out of her way to seek coverage under insurance for patients.

+1 Total hysterectomy on 22-year-old with concurrent medical issues.

[Dr. Susan VandenBosch](https://uofmhealthwest.org/doctors/susan-vandenbosch/) - I just met with her on 2/2 for the first time and scheduled my pre-surgical workup for early March and a bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation with her for March 25, 2022. I'm 32 and unmarried with zero kids/pregnancies. I've been with my partner for 8 years and he also doesn't want children. I've been asking to be sterilized since I was 18. Easiest medical conversation, no bingos at all, reasonable wait time - less than 8 weeks between first appointment and surgery appointment. She waited for me to bring the topic up, but was enthusiastic about discussing options with me. Only briefly asked about partner support - no pushback or reservations on her end. She mentioned that because I'm younger, an ablation might not be effective for my heavy/painful periods. However, she told me that if the ablation doesn't work, she is happy to perform a hysterectomy on me because we tried the bisalp/ablation first.

[Nisha McKenzie (PA-C) and Dr. Tami Michele (DO)](https://www.whcollective.com/) Women's Health Collective in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Bilateral Salpingectomy in October 2021 for a married, 30 year old, childfree female. Best medical experience of my life! WHC is very open-minded and willing to hear women out on their needs. Waited about 3 weeks for initial consult with Nisha. Then completed a formal consultation (as required by law) with Dr. Michele, surgery was scheduled for less than 30 days after Dr's consult.

[Michigan Urological Clinic](http://www.michiganurological.com/) - I'm pretty sure all doctors here are willing to do a vasectomy on someone whose child free. They're located in Grand Rapids, MI. My partner (21M) recently scheduled an appointment for July, little to no questions asked! This place was recommended by our friends (23(?)M & 20/21F) who had a great experience. Even though our friends aren't married/engaged she was able to make the call on his behalf and set up the appointment.

[Dr Meredith Carbone-Doyle](https://findadoctor.spectrumhealth.org/physician/profile/448) at the Spectrum Health Medical Group OB/GYN in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I got a bilateral salpingectomy at age 30 from her! At my first appointment she was polite and professional. She didn’t bingo me once, and asked if I wanted kids once. She took my answers and didn’t question them. Dr Carbone-Doyle also told me that she would be thrilled to have her named added to this list! She gave me great info on all of the sterilization techniques and helped me choose which one was best for me. From the appointment my surgery was scheduled for two months out! The day of the surgery at their surgical center I received nothing but amazing care. No bingos or rude staff.

[Dr Emily Malling](https://findadoctor.spectrumhealth.org/physician/profile/7353) Spectrum Health Medical Group Obstetrics & Gynecology 3800 Lake Michigan Dr NW, Suite A, Grand Rapids, MI 49534 performed a Bisalp on me (33F) with no children on 3/9/23. She was amazing and just asked if I was sure I didn’t want any children and then said we could go ahead and schedule the surgery. 10/10 recommend her, she was great and surgery was an easy recovery.

**Greenville** 

Dr. Andrea Sterling through Spectrum Health, had my first appointment with her and she approved me for a bilateral salpingectomy right away (I am 28 years old). She told me one of her biggest beliefs is patient autonomy, and that if I was 100% sure, then she was 100% sure. Got the procedure 12 days after first appointment.

**Haslett** 

[Dr Jacqueline Witters](https://cimamed.com/providers/jacqueline-witters-d-o/). Also works out of Charlotte. I am a 30 year old bisexual partnered(M) woman and I just got my tubal ligation done yesterday! I do not have children and have never been pregnant. I have been seeing my doctor for about 4 years now. I originally asked her about 6 months ago about tubal ligation. She explained the procedure to me, told me it’s her favorite to do, and told me to give them a call when I’m ready. I scheduled an appointment in July to discuss and get scheduled. She talked to me about the procedure went over consent and over the fact that it was permanent but did not press further. She told me she mostly had to go over all of it for consent purposes. She never tried to sway me either way. When I got a call back to schedule they were able to get me in within like 2 weeks, but I pushed it to the end of August. I can not recommend her more!

**Holland:** 

Michael Traver, MD, FACS and John Ludlow, MD. [Western Michigan Urological Associates](http://wmuro.com/), 577 Michigan Avenue, Suite 201, Holland, MI 49423. Vasectomy. Gave me absolutely no trouble, the subject of maybe changing my mind, kids, or even other options never came up. I was 24.

Dr. Thomas Fasbender, DO. [Spectrum Health Medical Group](https://www.spectrumhealth.org/), 588 E Lakewood Blvd, Holland, MI 49424. I first brought up a bilateral salpingectomy to him in my mid-twenties after hating the pill and Depo shots, but we agreed on the Mirena IUD instead because of his concerns about risking surgical complications, infection, etc. when there were still non-surgical options to try. Meanwhile, I discovered that I have the BRIP1 gene, which makes me much more prone to ovarian cancer, so when my first Mirena's time was up and another one couldn't be placed (long story, my cervix is an asshole), I brought up bilateral salpingectomy again, citing regret studies as well as studies showing that tube removal mitigates ovarian cancer risk by a significant amount without bringing on menopause. After hearing me out and discussing the pros and cons, he approved the surgery, and two weeks later I was on the table getting my tubes out.

**Howell:** 

[Dr. William K. Johnston III](https://www.michiganurology.com/doctor/william-k-johnston-m-d/). I am 28 years old and have no children. I am not married, however I have been with my partner for 4 years. I requested a consultation for a vasectomy from the Michigan Institute of Urology website. Before seeing Dr. Johnston, a nurse went over the procedure and consent form with me. Dr. Johnston asked some brief questions about if I already had children. I told him that I did not have any children and that myself and my partner did not wish to have any children. He seemed satisfied with my answer and did not press further. He did tell me he is reluctant to perform a vasectomy if someone seeks one because their partner told them too. The example he gave me was a late teen/early 20's male coming to him because his late 20's/early 30's girlfriend told him to get a vasectomy. I have the impression that as long as you express your desire to have a vasectomy is your own, you will not have much trouble convincing him. The day of the vasectomy he asked one more time to confirm I was sure I wanted the vasectomy. I said yes and he began the procedure. The procedure took no more than 15 minutes. The procedure was painless and he was diligent at making sure I did not feel anything.

[Dr. Laris E. Galejs](http://www.michiganurology.com/doctor/laris-e-galejs-m-d/) Specializes in scalpel-free vasectomy - Michigan Institute of Urology (Howell, Bright, Novi, Livonia; surgery out of Howell) 620 Byron, Suite 1201, Howell, Michigan 48843-1002 Tel: (517) 545-6548. Ask for consultation, asked only legalese-styled "you understand this is permanent" sort of questions (I am married, 27). Spent more time talking about soccer and Batman fighting Superman in surgery than we did at the consultation. Extremely friendly, polite, noninvasive. 

**Kalamazoo:** 

Siân West, DO I currently work in Kalamazoo, MI. I perform salpingectomies for sterilization. You do not need to be married, in a relationship, or have children in order to get a tubal ligation. I’m also happy to provide gender affirming surgeries. But I’m not trained in reconstruction. Our office takes almost every insurance out there.

[Dr. Zylkia Rodriguez](https://www.bronsonhealth.com/doctors/zylkia-rodriguez/) at Bronson Health in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Laparascopic tubal ligation with filshie clips. Dr. Rodriguez performed my tubal ligation. She had no problem with the fact I was 26 years old, child free, and unmarried. Due to Medicaid restrictions in Michigan, I did have to sign a document stating I understand the procedure is permanent 30 days before receiving the surgery, but 30 days isn't terribly far in advance to schedule a non-emergency surgery anyways. Dr. Rodriguez mentioned that she is happy to perform sterilizations for child free people because her close friend from college never wanted kids and was denied the procedure repeatedly.

Dr Scholten, Bronson's Women Services. She asked me to write a letter but was very open to me getting sterilized. There were other methods I hadn't tried, but she trusted me to know what I needed. I'm 23, and not a single bingo. I had my consult and 10 days later I had my surgery. She held my hand as I was going under anestesia. I'd highly suggest her to anyone in the area, even just for their regular gyno.

Dr. Erin Bouhana [Women's Excellence] Address: 1437, 1428 S Lapeer Rd, Lake Orion, MI 48360 Phone: (248) 693-0543 Hassle free. Bilateral salpingectomy for 25F (one and done). Super friendly and professional, Answers any of your questions or concerns. Surgery done in Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak. She's also available in Rochester Hills Women's Excellence office for appointments.

**Lansing:** 

Dr. Foucher in Lansing, MI. I am a single mid20s lesbian with no kids. I saw Dr. Foucher to ask about birth control or sterilization (strictly to prevent pregnancy on the chance of SA, and I mentioned that stopping periods and not majorly impacting hormones was ideal.) She was extremely respectful of my choice not to have kids when I asked her about sterilization or birth control options. She listed to my needs and never once questioned my decision. She listed possible regret/the permanency of sterilization when listing any other side effects or complications, and without judgement, not like she tried to “talk me out of it.” She stated that she trusted anyone coming in and asking for sterilization had thought about it and knew themselves best. She was very through and patient in describing options. Please note if you have Medicaid in MI you must wait 30 days after giving consent to actually be sterilized. Dr. Foucher thought this was as ridiculous as I did but apparently it’s a legal thing. I ended up going with a mirena IUD the same day but signed the consent for sterilization should I decide that’s right over a month. She was excellent in placing it, and told me what she was doing every step.

[Sparrow Hospital.](http://www.sparrow.org/women-obgyn-center) Hassle Free and friendly staff for tubal ligation. Dr. Lewis performed the surgery. He was awesome.

[Dr. Clara Regal](https://www.sparrow.org/physician/clara-m-regal). Dr. Regal is my primary OBGYN and preformed my bilateral salpingectomy on 8/4/2021 at sparrow hospital. I was very up front with her receptionist while scheduling the consult appointment. Our consultation was short and informative, I signed some paperwork stating I knew the procedure was permanent and irreversible. Surgery scheduling called within the week to get me on the OR schedule.

[Dr. Lena Weinman-Greenberg.](http://alliance-obgyn.com/): Contact info on website.  Hassle free and everyone is friendly.  Able to address questions and concerns.  Okayed surgery during initial consultation and did not seem to have any pre-reqs.  Was able to get a bilateral salpingectomy for childless 27F within about 2 months (and that time span was only due to scheduling for other tests and the surgical rotation).  Surgery done at Sparrow Hospital.

[Dr. Eric Stockall - Capital Urological Associates](https://capitalu.com/): (Main Office 2090 Jolly Road Okemos, MI 48864) (Vasectomy) Called and scheduled an appointment to do consultation and procedure in same day. No questions asked, staff was very friendly

**Livonia:** 

[West Side OB/GYN] Address: 36650 5 Mile Rd #101, Livonia, MI 48154 Phone:(734) 655-8250. Dr. Dimon did consultation to go over options, then approved for 27 years old. Cannot do bilateral for sterilization because the office is part of the Catholic hospital (St. Mary Mercy).

**Mt Pleasant** 

Erin DeCloux, MD. She is located at MyMichigan Medical Center, 4851 E Pickard Rd Suite 2100, Mt Pleasant, Michigan 48858. The phone number is (989) 772-3009. She completed a bilateral salpingectomy. Dr. DeCloux was amazing. I am 27 years old with no children. I told her I wanted the operation in early April. The operation was completed by the end of April. She gently reminded me about other birth control options, but as soon as I said no, she dropped the subject. (This felt like she legally had to say this as a reminder, not that she felt that way.) When I asked her if I could post her information on Reddit, she was very happy to help spread the news. She was friendly, informative, and helpful the entire time.

[Dr. Rachel Rezmer,MD](https://www.cmuhealth.org/doctors/Rachel-Rezmer-rezme1r) 600 East Preston St. (Foust Hall 200), Mount Pleasant, MI 48859
989-774-6599. Also in Saginaw. Dr. has reached out to us to advise:"I would love to be added to the list of physicians who are willing to perform sterilizations to child free individuals! I am an OBGYN practicing in Saginaw, MI at CMU Health at 1000 Houghton Ave Saginaw, MI 48602. I also have an office in Cass City, MI. I think all women should have autonomy over their bodies and think with the right counseling to make sure risks are understood, they should be allowed to make the choice that best suits them!"

**Macomb** 

Dr. Stephen F Redding Tubal Ligation 29F Doctor did mention that he prefers to do these for people 30 years and older, but I am not 30 yet and he did it for me without me having to argue. Went over regret statistics but says he 'just technically has to say it.'  Within about 30 seconds of him walking into the room he said he would do the procedure for me; we talked about 10 more minutes just going over everything and this included what I could expect on surgery day. Had a great experience on day of surgery, he went over everything again and made sure I didn't have any remaining questions before we went to OR.  The nurses at the hospital are great too

Nicole Dolan Bilateral Salpingectomy Possible age restrictions - OK for 30+, but will want to discuss

**Marshall:** 

[Dr Kathryn Young, MD](https://advancedgynspecialists.com/): Performs tubal ligation with filshie clips. Went to office for consultation, met with assistant. Had to convince her to allow me to convince the doctor that I really truly wanted the surgery at 27 years old. Appointment with Dr Young was short, paid full price for both the appointments. They managed to get me in for surgery just a couple weeks later. Surgery done by Dr Young at Oaklawn Hospital. Staff there is amazing. Overall, good experience. She is the chief of surgery for a reason.

**Mason** 

Alliance Obstetrics and Gynecology in Mason, Michigan. They also have a branch in East Lansing, Michigan. I brought up wanting the procedure a few months ago and they just asked me some routine questions, made sure I knew it was permanent, and set up the surgery for me, they even mentioned that they have preformed the surgery on women in their early 20s with no kids. My surgery was preformed by Dr. Behring and went great. Everyone was very professional, accepting, and supportive of my choices.

**Midland:** 

[Dr John A Lieberman, DO OBGYN](https://www.mymichigan.org/doctors/find-a-doctor-basic-profile/lieberman-john/), Center for Women's Health, 4320 Campus Ridge Drive, Midland, MI 48640, 989-839-3170. Body-positive doctor performed hysterectomy plus removal of tubes on 24-year-old woman with health issues relating to periods. Doctor was completely supportive of patient’s choice, although other physicians had refused, pushing IUDs, despite debilitating cramps and continuous bleeding, blaming patient's weight for their unwillingness to do surgery.  Patient said: “For once in my life, I heard a doctor say that I was old enough to make the choice to not have children…The people at this office work for you and are your cheerleaders from start to finish.” Doctor’s office also worked hard to get insurer approval.

[MPC](https://www.mpcenter.net/services/vasectomy) offers vasectomy services but it is not clear if the current practicing physicians are CF friendly.

No hassle at all and very friendly.

[Dr. Shawna Ruple, MD.](http://midmichiganobgyn.com/) I was able to get an appointment pretty quickly and with the first appointment she agreed to sterilization. No Bingo's just clarified it was a permanent sterilization, I didn't even have to fight my case. I'm a 27 year old unmarried woman, never been pregnant. 10/10 would let her cut me open again.

**Rochester Hills** 

[Dr. Staci Hopkins](https://www.oaklandmacombobgyn.com/provider/staci-hopkins-m-d). Southeast Michigan, USA. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. No bingos, approved surgery at consultation. I wrote a short essay detailing some of my reasons for wanting sterilization. Dr. Hopkins took the time to read it and agreed to remove my uterine tubes.

Dr. Todd Campbell and all of the comprehensive urology staff are awesome. No hesitation for vasectomy for 30yo & married.

**Royal Oak** 

[Dr. Elizabeth Smith](https://www.women-firstobgyn.com/our-experts/), Royal Oak Michigan Women first OB GYN. Address: 326 N Main St Royal Oak, MI 48067 United States.

Some insurances have the age restriction of being at least 21 and waiting 30 days from signing consent to have the operation performed, but otherwise I have no age or marital restrictions. No psych consult etc. required. Just a consult with me. LGBTQ+ friendly. I am not trained in transition medicine/surgery but am happy to refer patients as needed. 

**St Joseph** 

[Dr. Catharine Roos](https://www.spectrumhealthlakeland.org/bellanova-women's-health), from BellaNova Women's Health in St. Joseph, MI, only requires that you're 21 (to comply with certain Medicaid and private insurances). Tubal Ligation. No binder needed, no fake partner, just needed to be 21+ and know I wanted it. She did ask respectful questions to make sure the procedure would actually fix the problem I was experiencing (I mentioned hating my period, which a tubal wouldn't fix, and she checked to make sure it wasn't a gender dysmorphia issue).

**Traverse City:** 

[Dr. Timothy P. Madion MD](https://providers.munsonhealthcare.org/provider/Timothy+P.+Madion/2174242) Grand Traverse Women's Clinic, 1200 Sixth Street, Suite 400, Traverse City, MI 49684, 231-392-0650. Sept. 2022. Tubal ligation on 34-year-old CF redditor. Tubal ligation was free with priority health, office visit was $35. Office visit was in August of 2022, earliest appointment slot was September of 2022. Zero bingos, actually thought a tubal would be better for me than an IUD (which my primary had suggested). Also performed a tubal on my friend ten years ago, who was 25 and childfree, which is why I decided to go with him.

[Dr Kristen Duman Scholten](http://www.northwoodobgyn.com/), this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am an Ob/gyn in Michigan who also believes it is your body, your choice when it comes to sterilization. No judgement, no age limit, or no need to have had kids, or partners input (it’s your body after all). I would be honored to help care for any of you searching for elective sterilization via salpingectomy. Currently in Kalamazoo at Bronson Hospital but will be moving to Traverse City, MI, to Northwood Ob/gyn in August."

[William E. Nowak, D,O., F.A.C.O.O.G. Board Certified Obstetrician/Gynecologist](http://womenshealthpavilion.com/) in Traverse City, MI (Williamsburg) (231) 938-2366 No nagging or suggesting I should do something other than a tubal. Got the papers, made the appointments, and that was that!

Marcy Verplanck-Kanitz, D.O. Of Grand Traverse Women's Clinic in Traverse City, Mi didn't bingo me. She was super receptive to my concerns and didn't even require an updated exam to go through the process. She looked at my medical records prior and discussed options but understood my concerns and scheduled me for surgery in the same day. MiHealth (Michigan medicaid) pays for tubal ligation. There's a 30 day wait period after you sign for the procedure but it's covered after that.

**Troy:** 

[Dr Steven Lefkowitz Somerset Gynecology & Obstetrics](https://www.somersetgynecologyobstetrics.com/). Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 28f, married, no kids. Went to him on recommendation from Dr Bindu Suresh (another Beaumont doctor, primary care, highly recommend) to discuss options after my IUD. Dr Lefkowitz’s initial recommendation was waiting until my iud hit 5 years. Only question asked was if I was sure, asked about husband but did not ask to meet or speak with beforehand. I asked to schedule procedure earlier than planned due to world events, was given a date within a month with no pushback. 

[Jennifer Foley, MD](https://www.somersetgynecologyobstetrics.com/md/JFoley1). Address: 3290 W Big Beaver Rd # 444, Troy, MI 48084 Phone:(248) 816-9200. Dr. Foley does bilateral salpingectomy.

+1 Dr. Foley approved for Essure at 26 but required two appointments three months apart.

[Dr. Paige Paladino](https://www.somersetgynecologyobstetrics.com/do/paige-paladino-do). She's super LGBTQ+ friendly and believes you know your body best. She's very close with my PCP and just wanted me to run the idea of surgery by him first, but she had no problem performing a laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy-oophorectomy for me, 24F. 0 bingos as well! She performs surgeries out of Beaumont Royal Oak.

+1 Dr Paladino, I wanted to add/confirm that she never bingoed me , didn’t require me to consult with my pcp or want my husbands permission. I went in prepared to fight or justify but she just asked what I was there for and then told me the sterilization options. My surgery was scheduled about a month from my consultation. Her office and the entire surgical team were all wonderful and I never once felt judged or like I was making a mistake. 

**Utica** 

Doctor Cammy E Beglin at Clinton Women's Healthcare in Utica Michigan performed my bilateral salpingectomy. When I went to my appointment and asked to be sterilized, she didn't even blink. She asked if I was sure and then wanted to know when I wanted it done. My friend also went to her following my sterilization and she also approved my friend without any fuss. I cannot recommend her enough!

Dr. Nelson at Michigan Institute of Urology in Utica, MI, vasectomy consult and was scheduled for surgery. I'm 25M, no children. He would be a good addition to the list. Only person to ask if I'm sure was the MA doing intake. Dr. Nelson was straightforward - no bingos, no challenges or dogmatic language. I didn't have to defend my position; he just informed me about sperm banking and scheduled me for the first available appointment.

**Warren:** 

[Cristina Alfieri, MD.](http://www.hutzel.org/), Hutzel Women's Hospital Detroit, MI. (586) 558-1110 (Warren office). Hassle-free and friendly. Prescribes Depo prior to procedure (Essure). Hesitant if you're under 25, though.

Also @ Hutzel, Dr. David Kmak approved after brief consultation for bilat. salpingectomy at 33.

-1 Hutzel Women's Hospital: user mentions that they do not sterilize women under 30.

**Warren:** 

[Mission OB-GYN](http://www.missionobgyn.net/) in Warren, MI. 586-574-1313. It's a practice of several doctors who are incredibly knowledgeable and supportive - the practice's motto is, "By women, for women." They really stand by it. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, which their website says they accept.  It seems like they do in fact take it, as long as it is through an employer and not the AHA (Marketplace).  I wasn't able to see them. NB Dr Bayci refused to consider sterilisation for a user who was under 30, despite genetic conditions which make pregnancy/childbirth unsafe. 

**West Bloomfield:** 

[Neil Simmerman](https://www.henryford.com/physician-directory/s/simmerman-neil) at Henry Ford West Bloomfield: Performed tubal ligation on 23 year old using filshie clips. Procedure and visits completely covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield FEP.

+1 Neil Simmerman at Henry Ford West Bloomfield as a 27F and he approved me without much fuss on my first visit, with surgery scheduled for the next week. He made sure I was aware of other options such as Paragard but didn't try and fight me about getting sterilized. He performs multiple methods of sterilization including essure, tubal with filshie clips, and bilateral salpingectomy.

+1 Dr Simmerman: Approved 24f for bilateral salpingectomy after 5 minutes of discussion!

[Dr. Rachel O’Keefe](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/rachel-okeefe-760207), [Walnut Lake Obgyn](https://walnutlakeobgyn.com). Procedure: Bilateral salpingectomy. Age: 33 (unmarried, no children). Never a single bingo once even during the initial consultation. She told me “you’re old enough to make decisions about your own body” and was super professional and kind the whole time. During the surgery too, none of the doctors she worked with ever said anything about me not wanting kids. It was literally the best experience I could’ve hoped for.

**Wyoming:** 

Alexander P. Dehaan, D.O [Urology Consultants](http://www.urologic-consultants.com/) in Wyoming, MI: Metro Health Village 2093 Health Drive, Suite 202 Wyoming, MI 49519 (616) 459-4171  | Zero problems getting a vasectomy, just the expected questions about reasons for wanting it. Approved for surgery at 20 years old, got the surgery at 21.

**Ypsilanti**

[S. Elena Gimenez, MD](https://ihacares.com/providers/mi/ypsilanti/s-elena-gimenez-md?utm_source=googlemybusiness&utm_campaign=Google%20My%20Business&utm_medium=organic), Trinity Health IHA Medical Group, Urology - Ann Arbor Campus, 5333 McAuley DrSuite 3001, Ypsilanti, MI, 48197. I had a vasectomy done. I'm 25 and engaged and do not have any children. The experience with Gimenez was great. She presented the information that I needed to know about getting a vasectomy. She did ask if I had any kids during the consultation, but did not have anything to say about it which was nice. She was very professional and did not "bingo" me in any way.


[Dr. R Deenadayalu, MD, OBGYN] (https://ihacares.com/providers/mi/ypsilanti/rajiv-deenadayalu-md) Trinity Health IHA Medical Group Obstetrics and Gynecology, 4936 W. Clark Rd Suite 100, Ypsilanti, MI 48197, (734) 434-6200. Dr. is body positiver. Bisalp on 25-year-old unmarried woman. “I brought up pursuing a bisalp and he was instantly on board! He agreed with what I was saying, and told me that his scheduler was going to call me in a weeks time to set a surgery time. He did have to explain that there is a higher rate of regret for younger people if they sterilized but he mentioned that it was just one of the talking points that he had to discuss."

+1 Dr. Deenadayalu Oct 2022. Bisalp on 41-year-old redditor. The doctor was one of the most body positive I have ever encountered. I asked him at my initial consult about how my weight would affect the surgery, and if I should worry about any problems. He told me that while extra fatty tissue may make him have to move the tools differently, it was his job to worry about being a good surgeon and mine to worry about taking it easy to heal after. 

###MINNESOTA

**Andover** 

[Dr. David Robert Bachman](https://www.fairview.org/providers/b/a/c/h/m/bachmandavid-736523866). Vasectomy, F26. He was very informative on the process and how to reverse it if I ever wanted to. Very easy going as well as good jokes about the procedure. There were no bingos : he knew neither me or my wife wanted kids. I told him we had known for a while. Met with him without my wife immediately following yearly checkup and talked for less than fifteen minutes. Day of operation was only in the office for an hour. Had to sign the legal paper, get anesthesia to take hold, less than 30 minutes for operation, and then wait until I could walk out to the car. He let my wife be in the room for support. Twelve weeks later for semen analysis. May sterilise as young as 19yo. 

**Bemidji** 

[Johnna Nynas, MD.](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/johnna-nynas). Network: Sanford Health, Bemidji Main Clinic, 1233 34th St NW Bemidji MN 56601. Went in to get a consult for sterilization, I was super careful to word my visit more as to "discuss birth control" just to make sure I could get in the door. I live in a pretty red part of the state, so I'd say my paranoia is a bit warranted. Gave me the "I have to tell you the risks" speech but did not bingo or judge me, just had to sign a consent form. Haven't been through the actual surgery yet, but I've got high hopes for this one!

**Bloomington** 

[Margaret Sweeney, MD](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/98809/), of HealthPartners Riverside. My primary care doctor referred me to her for a bilateral salpingectomy after it became clear that I wasn't backing down on sterilization. Margaret didn't question my decision once; just briefly went over my history of what I've tried, why those methods didn't work for me, and what I hadn't tried, verified that I wasn't interested in the non-permanent options I hadn't tried yet, and got me scheduled immediately. For what it's worth, I'm 31 and married with no children. I was also recently diagnosed with a couple autoimmune disorders, which could have played a factor in how easy this process was this time around. I really think Margaret would treat any patient the same way she treated me though. 

+1 Dr Sweeney has recently sterilised a 22 year old woman as well. 

+1 Dr Sweeney  I am 21, unmarried, no kids and i just got home from my procedure. She did a great job and was very quick to get me in. 

+1 Dr Sweeney, I'm 21 and just had a bilateral salpingectomy done by Dr. Sweeney who treated me with so much kindness and respect. She never once questioned my decision she simply made sure I was aware of the risks vs benefits then went ahead and got me scheduled! I was so relieved I didn't have to fight to be heard. I couldn't recommend her enough.

+1 Dr Sweeney, She was so nice - listened, never judged or tried to dissuade me, just stated the facts (it's permanent, etc etc). She always communicated before, during, and after the procedure. I'm super happy with her!

**Buffalo** 

Dr Leslie Akram, Buffalo MN, USA did my tubal ligation in 2018. She clipped mine but she mentioned at my last appt that nowadays, she just takes the tubes right out most of the time. So I know she still does them and has done them multiple times. Of course I don't know her other patients situations, but I was 25, married, no kids, went to my appt alone to talk about tubal ligation, and she booked the surgery for me that same day.

**Burnsville**

[Jennifer M Schlies, DO](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/104890/) Burnsville Women’s Services-OB GYN 14101 Fairview Drive Burnsville, MN 952-993-3282. Bilateral Salpingectomy. She was absolutely wonderful! She came recommended by a friend who had a partial hysterectomy and she does not bingo at all and says your personal choices are valid.

+1 Dr. Schlies. Dec 2022. Bisalp on 23-year-old redditor. Wait time between scheduling and consultation was about 4 weeks. No bingos and was immediately supportive when asked about sterilization options, and suggested Lap BiSalp as it is the least likely to cause complications and has lower failure rates than other sterilization options. Understood the current political climate was a factor in decision and that anyone old enough to make a medical decision about their body should be allowed to do so.

[Dr. Maureen Ayers Looby, MD MPH](https://mhealthfairview.org/providers/Ayers-LoobyMaureen-1285991315). M Health Fairview Ridges hospital and the Surgery Center, Ridgeview Medical Building, 303 E. Nicollet Blvd., Burnsville, MN, 55337 (~15 minutes from the MSP international airport) 952-460-4000 (~15 minutes from the MSP international airport). Doctor’s statement: “OBGYN practicing on Burnsville, MN at M. Does sterilization via bilateral salpingectomy. No restriction on marital status or child free status. Generally must be age 21 or older, some exceptions may be warranted. LGBTQ+ friendly. Accepts most insurances including UCare. Dr. Ayers Looby does initial consultation via tele visit if requested.”

+1 Dr. Maureen Ayers Looby in Burnsville, MN (bilateral salpingectomy) - wanted to share my (very positive) experience! I am 32 & married, no kids. Dr. Ayers Looby went over the risks of the procedure, as is required. No bingos, she in no way tried to sway me out of my decision, didn't ask about my husband's opinion, and even asked if I wanted to get rid of my periods with an IUD since there's no point in having them if I don't want kids. I was able to schedule my surgery, which took place 2 months after my appointment with her. I was only in the operating room for 45 minutes. She is a wonderful doctor & I never felt judged for my decision!

**Chaska** 

[Dr. Huldeen](https://westernobgyn.com/people/andraya-j-huldeen-md/). Age: 25 Marital Status: Single Childfree Status: No kids and completed bilateral salpingectomy Jan 2023. Dr. Huldeen was upbeat, believed I knew what was best for my body, and didn't question that in the slightest. No bingos. I was completely taken aback at how professional she was. Short wait times for a consultation appointment (<2 weeks) and I believe it was less than a month after consultation that the first surgery date was offered. I have BCBS of MN and it was fully covered.

**Coon Rapids** 

Dr Nancy Webster in Coon Rapids, MN through Allina - sterilised 32yo childfree single woman. "The doctor said that the times had changed and that as long as I signed a consent form then there was no way that a doctor could tell me no."

**Detroit Lakes** 

[Dr. Deraney](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/jaimie-deraney?yxt_info=provider-C45A2DC5-8997-48DC-8A9F-FBC821E9F0C1&y_source=1_MTk2NTM0MjMtNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D) completed my bilateral salpingectomy when I was 26 with no children. I brought my husband along to my consult, however, I also sent an unmarried and childfree friend, 23, his way and he did her surgery as well. He did tell me he disagreed with my choice but would honor my decision.

**Duluth** 

[Dr. Jennifer Boyle](http://www.slhduluth.com/Physician-Directory/B/Dr-Jennifer-R-Boyle-FACOG.aspx) St. Luke’s Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Associates (Bilateral Salpingectomy, laparoscopic). She just asked a few questions about whether I, 27 unmarried, had considered other methods and whether I was sure. They were willing to schedule the next month. The procedure was really easy and the whole surgical staff at St Lukes was wonderful.

+1 I found Dr. Jennifer Boyle listed above and had a similar experience. She trusted my choice in a bilateral salpingectomy but also provided information on tieing tubes using a silicone band. I scheduled the surgery the following month and have always had great experiences with St. Luke's Hospital system.

[Dr. Haley Meyer, MD](https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/haley-meyer/).  Essentia Health 420 E 1st St., Duluth, MN 55805, 844-663-1068. I (34/F/married/no history of pregnancy) had bilateral salpingectomy with Dr. Meyer in December 2020. She was excellent throughout the entire process. At my consult, she walked in and said, "I know why you're here and that's all I need to know," and, "No one should be forced to be pregnant against their will." I didn't have to explain or defend anything. I also attended the appointment alone which was no problem - she trusts you've worked it out with your partner and is not interested in their position, since it's about you. I cannot recommend her enough!

[Dr. Karin Knutson, MD] (https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/karin-knutson/) Essentia Health, 420 E 1st St., Duluth, MN 55805, 844-663-1068. Also in Miller’s Bridge. Doctor is LBGTQ+ friendly. Bisalp on 29-year-old CF redditor. Dr. Knutson has great bedside manner. She asked routine questions, e.g., if I was partnered.  I explained that my partner (at the time) was a trans woman, and Dr. Knutson didn't bat an eye.
She asked me to briefly describe why I was seeking sterilization. I received no pushback or bingoes. I made a sterilization binder, but she didn't even ask to look at it.The staff at Essentia Health was wonderful during my experience.

**Eden Prairie**

Dr. Jennifer Smolinski, she agreed to a hysterectomy literally the first time we ever spoke, due to me having a massive fibroid, and not wanting any children. My fibroid is located in a spot where the uterus technically doesn't need to come out to solve the issue, but Dr. Smolinski agreed with my request to take it out anyway because she respected my desire to be rid of an organ I don't want to use. Considering that she's heavily pregnant herself, I was not expecting her to be so understanding and all around wonderful to work with. I hope her addition to the wiki can help others get sterilized too!

Milton Ropes - Vasectomy, 32

**Glencoe**

[Dr. John Heller.](https://grhsonline.org/service/urology/). Vasectomy. Was not made to feel uncomfortable or pressured to have a kid first, wait, or save sperm. 

**Hibbing** 

[Dr Lane Meyer](https://www.fairview.org/providers/MeyerLane-828117435) at Fairview Mesaba in Hibbing. Was referred to him for my tubal when I was 26. Had one consult visit to go over the risks of an ablation and what to expect after surgery. No questions and was very respectful. 

**Lakeville** 

Dr. Furuseth in Minnesota, Lakeville/Burnsville area. I (25F) got a bilateral salpingectomy from her, no bingo-ing from her or her staff. Just confirmation of pros, cons, and that i knew this was permanent (to get pregnant naturally. She acknowledged ivf and adoption should i ever change my mind in the future. Stated neutrally, not demeaning or bingo-y).

**Mankato** 

[Dr. Amy L. Brien, MD OBGYN](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-brien-md) I got a bilateral salpingectomy. Her questions were mostly… Are you aware this is permanent? What is your current method of birth control? Have you been pregnant before? How long have you known you don’t want to have children? I am 30, single and child free (forever now! Yay!)

Dr. Mark Taylor - Mankato Clinic. Asked for an IUD at 26. He suggested a tubal removal at my consultation since I was sure I never wanted kids. It was my first time meeting him. "I'd love to give you a tubal." Very friendly. Funny, jokes around, but very straight to the point and makes things easy to understand. I had horrible hospital anxiety but it's disappeared completely since I've been seeing him. IUD migrated, he wanted to do an ultrasound, a mass was found on my ovary and we scheduled surgery right there. Decided to go ahead with a tubal in the same surgery since it was in my future anyway and they had to go in to remove the mass. Diagnosed with endometriosis during surgery. He was so anxious about whether the mass on my ovary was benign or not (it was rather scary looking and he'd never seen anything like it) that he called me with results the second pathology got back to him the next morning. While I was recovering from anesthesia he kept my fiance very informed and up to date. I'd trust this guy with my life. NB Dr Taylor no longer performs surgery. He will still accept and see patients but if they want surgery, he will refer them to another provider in the dept.

[Ashley Thorson](https://www.mankatoclinic.com/providers/ashley-thorson) 1230 East Main Street Mankato, Minnesota 56001, Bilateral Salpingectomy, 23F, unmarried, does not have/want children. Clinic is LGBTQ+ friendly. All providers in the OB dept. are open-minded and accepting of people seeking permanent birth control. Dr. Thorson was very respectful, informed me of my options, and made sure I understood what I was asking for. She reassured me this was 100% my decision to make and she would support whatever I chose to do.

[Dr. Scott Barnacle](https://www.mankatoclinic.com/providers/scott-barnacle-md). 22F, unmarried, no children bilateral salpingectomy. I met Dr. Barnacle for the first time for a pap smear and brought up sterilization. He immediately started discussing options with me and we landed on bilateral salpingectomy. He didn't bingo me once and even though I had my bf with me during my appointment and Dr. Barnacle hardly acknowledged him. I got a call from his office to schedule the surgery the next business day and I got the surgery done a month later. He was nice and respectful every time I saw him. I never once felt like I was being talked down to by him or his staff. I cannot recommend Dr. Barnacle enough, he was absolutely and I want to give him a hug.

**Maple Grove** 

[Dr. Jillian Hallstrom MD](https://www.oakdaleobgyn.com/care_team_member/jillian-m-hallstrom-m-d/) 9825 Hospital Drive, Suite 205, Maple Grove, MN 55369, 763-587-7000. Jan. 2023. Bisalp on 31-year-old redditor. I had my consultation with Dr. Hallstrom at Oakdale OBGYN in December 2022 for a Bisalp, as Dr. Meyer was unavailable. Dr. Hallstrom performed it in January 2023. Dr. Hallstrom listened to me and was kind and understanding, as was the APRN Megan who performed my physical and care establishment visit. Neither of them questioned my sanity or tried to talk me down from my decision.

[Dr. Anna Meyer M.D.](https://www.oakdaleobgyn.com/care_team_member/anna-meyer-m-d/) Oakdale Obstetrics & Gynecology - Maple Grove, MN. Performed a salpingectomy on me, 25 year old female. I came in fully prepared to give an entire book of reasons as to why I wanted the surgery, but it was unnecessary. She was fantastic, helpful and believed I knew what was best for my body. She went through all the standard info that was required. Made sure I knew the risks, and that the procedure was permanent. When I confirmed I still wanted the surgery, and that I had no desire to ever become pregnant, she was happy to schedule my surgery and help me!

[Dr. Cecil Bassett](https://www.fairview.org/providers/BassettCecil-1838359455). the procedure was done in Maple Grove, MN, but it looks like he also works in Fridley, MN. I'm 34, not married, no kids. My initial consultation was very easy. No bingos. He just gave me all the risks/alternatives and asked if I still wanted to do it. Procedure was scheduled about 7 weeks later.

**Minneapolis** 

[Dr. Megan Bina](https://www.voyagehealthcare.com/megan-bina-do). My experience: Surgery occurred in 2019. I was 27, single, no kids. Be sure to contact your insurance to get the exact procedures and billing codes that they cover 100% for female sterilization. Then provide those procedures and codes to your doctor to ensure that this will be 100% covered!

Dr Gabra - Works at the University of MN Women's Health Center and is very supportive of patient autonomy, no pressure or judgement about being CF.

[Christy Boraas](https://med.umn.edu/bio/obgyn-faculty/christy-boraas) 25f, single and got approved for a bi-salp. Absolutely no bingoing at all, she was super sweet and approved it right away once I said that I know I don't want kids and am getting the procedure within 30 days.

[Katherine Eggleston, MD,](https://www.healthpartners.com/fcp/care-team/?locationId=59882&networkId=1052). Vasectomy. Initial consult took maybe 20 minutes to go over the procedure and answer questions, and the procedure was tentatively scheduled later that day. Procedure itself was about a month later, and again, no bingos. Just confirmation that I was making an informed decision. Was 27 at the time of the consult and procedure. Had to travel for the surgery and was able to send in semen sample to a PP clinic in town 3 months later. Results were returned very quickly.

[Thomas Gerst, MD](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-thomas-gerst-xt9fv)

Dr. John Hering - HealthPartners Riverside Clinic in Minneapolis. Referred to him by my normal NP as someone willing to sterilize women without children. During appointment mentioned being willing to sterilize women as young as 21 years of age. The only question he asked was if I understood that the decision was permanent, otherwise did not even ask why I wanted the procedure as he believes women are capable of making these informed decisions themselves. Lovely man, and his staff love him too!

[Dr. Samantha Pace](https://www.hennepinhealthcare.org/provider/samantha-pace-md/) - Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. Went in for a hysterectomy consultation and was only asked about if I also wanted an oophorectomy and/or vaginectomy. When discussing hysterectomies she stated she believes anyone who wants a hysterectomy should be able to get one and is willing to work with younger patients. She is also trans friendly (nursing staff was only partially trans friendly) and willing to work with insurance.

Dr. Rebecca French at University of Minnesota Medical Center - Women's Health Specialists Clinic. (https://med.umn.edu/bio/obgyn-faculty/rebecca-french). I (25F, no kids, never married) got a referral from my primary to see Dr. French and she was great about everything. Said she prefers to do a bisalp, didn't seem bothered by my age. Surgery went well, highly recommend her. 

Dr. Bryan Hotujec: Allina Health Mercy Women's Health Clinic in Coon Rapids/Allina Health Brooklyn Park Clinic (Both are near Minneapolis, Minnesota) I was able to get a bilateral salpingectomy from him age 20, he was completely respectful of my choices but he referred me to get a second opinion from another doctor before approving me which he requires for all patients.

[Dr Sarah Leadley](https://www.mhealthfairview.org/providers?addressQuery=&page=1&placeId=&searchQuery=Leadley&sortOrder=) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. No bingos, no issues whatsoever from this physician or anyone in the OB department. The initial OB suggested didn't perform the procedure I wanted and was also amazing. Easiest procedure ever, no resistance at all, speedy recovery, no pain. I'd recommend it to anyone who is sure.

[Dr. Andrea Flom](https://haugenobgyn.com/our-providers/our-doctors/andrea-flom/), with Haugen OB/GYN in Minneapolis, MN. I am 33, married for 2 years (but have been with my husband for nearly 14 years), and 100% childfree. Never, ever wanted kids from the moment I could even comprehend that's what the female body does. Went for an IUD replacement, joked that I really wanted sterilization and Dr. Flom switched gears during the appointment to accommodate that request. Procedure is a laproscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Wait time was 2 weeks, as we had to work around the surgery center schedule. Insurance will 100% cover it - private insurance through employer. Absolutely no bingos. Dr. Flom said it was 100% my choice and that was it.

[Dr. Samantha Hoffman](https://med.umn.edu/bio/obgyn-faculty/samantha-hoffman), an OBGYN surgeon at M Health Fairview University of Minnesota Medical Center. She is a really great doctor and never questioned me, always clarifying when she had to say specific things like "there is a risk of regret" that she did not say them to invalidate me, but because it was policy or legal. She was great at making sure I understood everything and even provided me labeled pictures of my organs after the surgery! I highly recommend Dr. Hoffman. And based on my conversations with her, I think every doctor at her clinic (Women's Health Specialists Clinic) is going to be supportive of patient's personal reproductive decisions while providing effective, compassionate, and informative care.

+1 [Dr Hoffman](https://providers.mhealthfairview.org/provider/Samantha+Hoffman/2239837). I had a bisalp as a 26F. I'm unmarried with no kids and had an abortion a couple months prior. The process was so easy and I didn't have to defend my decisions. Also: [Dr Jessika Ralph](https://providers.mhealthfairview.org/provider/Jessika+Ralph/2240958). She's the doctor I actually had my consultation with. She didn't question my decision at all and only went over what she legally had to about how some women regret it. She approved my surgery, but I ended up getting it done by Samantha because of scheduling.

Dr. Cristina Gonzalez-Mendez and she practices out of the M Health Fariview women's clinic in Minneapolis Minnesota. The only questions she asked were for me to quickly explain my reasons for permanent sterilization and then she said "sounds good" and we moved on to discussing details of a bilateral salpingectomy. Zero judgment and so kind in her bedside manner, I want to help other people find her for sterilization!

[Dr Mary Mahoney](https://mhealthfairview.org/providers/MahoneyMary-1386727857) at Fairview Health in Minneapolis, MN performed my tubal ligation via cauterization at 23, single, with no children. Consult was quick and painless. She was very respectful, and I wish I still lived in MN so I could still see her!

[Eric Heegard, MD](https://www.drheegaard.com/)

**Monticello**

Danielle Schirm, DO. I was referred to her by my primary family doctor (Holly Hett at Apple Valley Medical Center) after letting her know my wishes. I scheduled an appointment with the OB/GYN clinic at Fairview Hospital in Burnsville and went in for an initial consultation with Dr. Schirm. She asked why I have chosen this choice (preference + family medical history) and why my husband isn't doing a vasectomy instead. Then she gave me 2 options: getting tubes tied or tubes removed, which reduces the risk of ovarian cancer. I decided on the latter and scheduled a bilateral salpingectomy for 3 months later. She did not have an attitude or was judgmental at all - she was rather friendly the whole time. No one in the office made any comments either. FYI I am 31 and married, no children. This doctor has recently relocated to Monticello. 

**Moose Lake** 

[Randy J. Rice, M.D. of Gateway Family Health Clinic](https://gatewayclinic.com/providers/dr-randy-j-rice-m-d/). My childfree friend had a vasectomy performed by him at age 27. I have gotten one done by him now at age 33. Neither of us were hassled or bingoed. Just explained the procedure and emphasized it's permanent. Had one visit for him to explain things and then two weeks later performed the surgery.

**Plymouth** 

[Dr Sovell, Minnesota Urology](https://mnurology.com/physicians/chase-k-sovell/). Vasectomy. NB Dr Sovell also practices at Edina. 

**Rochester** 

Dr. Daniel Breitkopf of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. I had my consultation with him in January, two months before turning 30. He never once tried to dissuade me from sterilization, he just simply went over other long-term birth control options that I may be interested in. I scheduled my bisalp surgery for May 10th and so far so good! He is an amazing doctor.

**Shoreview** 

Dr. Kimberly Fischer at Allina Health Shoreview Clinic: https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/990
I got a bilateral salpingectomy done by Dr. Kimberly Fischer at the age of 28, and had an excellent experience with the whole process. During the consultation, she does briefly discuss how permanent the procedure is and ask if you are REALLY sure you never want children, but doesn't push the issue at all. I confirmed that I was positive about my choice, and she immediately moved forward with scheduling me. The surgery took place about 3 months after the consult, and the pain/recovery was SO minimal... I was back to normal in under a week, and the worst pain day was maybe a 3 or 4 out of 10. I'm lucky I found her, and so grateful I was able to have the procedure done!

**St Cloud** 

[Maggie Thronaum, DO](https://www.centracare.com/doctors/maggie-l-thronaum-do/) Practice: CentraCare (St Cloud, MN). This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "Large multi-specialty system, accepts most insurances. Notes: LGBTQ friendly. No limitations on age, marital status, etc."

**St Louis Park** 

Janet M Schaffer, MD Womens Center Obstetrics/Gynecology Methodist Hospital St. Louis park, MN. Dr. Schaffer was very friendly and did a great job on my surgery. The only thing she asked me was that I am 100% sure about it. I said yes and we moved along. No other questions asked. I highly recommend her.

[Dr. Matthew Banfield](http://www.parknicollet.com/bios/banfield-a-matthew). Specialties in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, OB-GYN. Treats at Methodist Hospital 6500 Excelsior Blvd. St. Louis Park, MN 55426 (952) 993-3282. Dr Banfield approved and performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 26 year old female. There were no bingo's, he only went through the motions of asking about my decision, mentioned long term birth control alternatives, and surgery risk factors. Right away, though, he assured me he would be okay with performing the surgery, and has performed many in the past. He recommended the bilateral salp. even before I brought it up. Great personality, light-hearted with a good sense of humor. He only required a pre-op to clear me for surgery and then I had the procedure done the following week. Everything went smoothly and I was given photographs of the removed tubes, as i'd requested. Note with private insurance (not through employers) there is a 30 day period between the consultation and surgery. That was what I was told, at least. I didn't have that wait since I have insurance via my employer.

[Dr. Daniel Zapzalka-Park Nicollet Urology](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/15984/). 28M went in for vasectomy consult, literally asked me two questions (do you have kids? You sure you don't want them?) and then agreed to the procedure and went over relevant patient education. Was able to schedule about a month and a half out.

[Dr Blake Noennig](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/181463/) - I recently had a vasectomy done by him. I'm a 26M who is engaged. We had the consultation over the phone, lasted only about 6 minutes. Going over what the procedure was. Asked me if I knew the risks and why I wanted one. No bingo phrases just accepted what I had to say, and was able to schedule the vasectomy that day. Got lucky with timing and had the vasectomy 5 days after the consultation. Was very quick, never forced me to answer a million questions, didn't even have to tell him I was child free. Brought my fiance with me for the procedue and he was very friendly. Awesome experience!!

**St Paul** 

Dr. Ruth L. Merid -  Saint Paul - 651-293-8100 - Approved a 22 yo f for a hysterectomy. Did require psych consults, one with SO and a family member. Unsure if it's required. 

[Dr. Laura France](https://www.fairview.org/providers/f/r/a/n/c/francelaura-937205408), she sterilized me (F 27) with a bisalp, in the friendliest and most accepting way possible. I came prepared to explain myself and she did not ask for any justification. I joked, "I was even prepared to write an essay." She said that's not necessary. I highly recommend Dr. France and the M Health Fairview Maplewood location and staff.

[Dr. Jennifer Peoples](https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/6289). St Paul, MN. She was wonderful. I'm 28, and had a bilateral salpingectomy. The appointment lasted all of five minutes, just me saying "I want to get my tubes tied." She told me that I could even have them removed, which was wonderful and what I chose to do. I cried on my way home because I had a whole speech prepared and I was so relieved I didn't have to resort to that. Didn't even need to tell her about my partner or anything. She had one of her assistants call me the next week to schedule me for surgery at United Hospital in St Paul. I did have to wait 30 days after the initial appt because my insurance required a waiver be signed that I still wanted to do it so that may vary for others. I only had to stay overnight because of a genetic thing, but it was nothing she did wrong and she was still profusely apologetic. If I ever have to have anything else done down there, absolutely going back!

[Dr. Stephen J. Lukasewycz, MD]( https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/80903/). HealthPartners Specialty Center – Urology, 435 Phalen Blvd, Saint Paul, MN 55130-5302, 651-254-8500. 2022. Vasectomy on married redditor, with no hesitation. The only question he asked was, "you know this is a permanent procedure, correct?" Vasectomy performed the next week. Doctor was very knowledgeable, answered all questions, and gave thorough aftercare instructions. Could not give him a better recommendation! He's a great doctor who respects your reproductive rights!

[Dr. Jennifer Willette, OBGYN](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/find/doctor/94824/) Network: Health Partners. Lakeview Hospital 921 Greeley St S, Stillwater, Minnesota 55082-5935. First agreed to do my tubal in 2019 when I was 25, single & no kids, and even onn state insurance. Gave me the "I have to tell you the risks" speech but did not bingo or judge me, just had to sign the 30 day consent form for Medicaid (she collects it regardless of insurance type). Had to delay for work reasons, but finally got my bilateral salpingectomy May 2021. Healing well. Great experience all around.

**Waconia** 

[Dr. Lisa Chapman](https://lakeviewclinic.com/physicians/lisa-m-chapman-m-d/). Completed procedure: laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy Information about me: 30 years old, cisgender female, married, and completely childfree. I asked Dr. Chapman if she had done this procedure on younger patients, and she says that she will do more thorough counseling with younger patients, but in the end will sterilize if that is what the patient wants. NB this doctor may want multiple consultations and a wait time before moving forward with sterilisation. 

**Woodbury** 

[Kat Corcoran, MD, OB/GYN, Woodbury MN](https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/18149). This gynecologisy has reached out to advise, "It's a private practice, but we accept Medicare and other MA insurance. Most insurance in the area (MN and WI) covers Allina. I do tubals including bilateral salpingectomies on anyone 21+ (per federal requirements) regardless of relationship/marital status. I'll also do a hysterectomy on anyone who wants one as long as I can find a diagnosis for insurance purposes (heavy or painful periods is totally sufficient). I am personally queer and poly, and am LGBTQIA+, kink, poly, etc friendly. I perform gender affirming hysterectomy and salpingectomy with or without removal of ovaries and prescribe gender affirming hormone therapy.

[Jennifer Flynn, MD of MetroOBGYN.](https://metropartnersobgyn.com/our-team) My primary care doctor referred me to her when I asked about permanent sterilization. Our first office visit was great! She gave me the spiel about 'oh you might change your mind' but she didn't press me on it or bingo me at all when I said I was 110% sure I wanted this. We discussed options and I chose to remove my tubes. We set a date and the whole thing was a breeze. The surgery was great - she has a fantastic demeanor and although I've probably spoken to her for less than an hour total, I realy like her. She's super friendly! I'm 27F, unmarried, no kids. 

###MISSISSIPPI

**Gulfport/Biloxi** 

[Dr. Jason P. Shannon](http://www.gulfportmemorial.com/mhg/find-a-doctor/shannon-p-jason-105.aspx).  Not judgemental at all.  Isn't CF himself, but totally supports and understands the reasons a couple may want to be "DINKs" for life.  Very easy going and understood where I was coming from in my decision to have a vasectomy.  Bonus points he lets you choose how you want to have the procedure done (no scapel, scapel, etc.) and explained the ups/downs of each.  If I ever need urology care in the future this is my go to guy.

**Hattiesburg**

[Dr. Troy McIntire](http://www.womenspavilionms.com/directory/people/show/troy-mcintire)(Tubal). Everyone at the Women's Pavilion is super nice and very supportive. 

[Dr. Shantele Bolton](https://womenspavilionms.com/people/dr-shantele-bolton/) at the Women’s Pavilion of South Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy for single, CF 25 year-old female. No bingoes, super understanding and values bodily autonomy, just wanted to make sure I was certain.

Dr. John Moore, urologist in Hattiesburg, MS, will perform vasectomies on men without children. He performed one on my husband.

**Jackson**

[Dr. Mark Condon](http://www.urologyassociatesofms.com/about/mark_a_condon.htm)(vasectomy). I showed up to the consult without my wife and the extent of him grilling me was: "So you don't want kids?" I said no, and he immediately moved forward to the content of the consult. Incredibly professional and warm. Him and the whole crew put me at ease during the procedure.

[Dr. Allen M. Haraway](http://www.msurology.com/doctors/dr_allen_haraway.html)(vasectomy). Serious couples are ok, unknown on individuals however.

Dr. Lindsey Turner Clinic: East Lakeland OBGYN Procedure: Tubal Ligation About me: 30yo female, 0 pregnancies, childfree since 21yo. Dr. Turner is an amazing doctor! I explained to her that I did not want children, and she literally said it’s my body my choice and that she would do the surgery. The best part? Tubal ligation is covered by insurance! Bilateral salpingectomy will cost money, however. She took the time to explain what all will happen during the 20 minute surgery and what all I would need for recovery.

**Meridian** 

[Dr Alyse Hobgood Boswell](https://www.rushhealthsystems.org/providers/physicians/alyse-hobgood-boswell/). I saw Dr. Boswell, at Rush Hospital, in Meridian, MS. I am 30F, Married, No children. Had a Hysterectomy Bilateral Salpingectomy (removed Tubes, Uterus & Cervix).

**Oxford** 

[Dr. Brent Hardin.](https://ouassociates.com/about-us/brent-hardin-md/) He isn't childfree himself, but was very respectful of my autonomy as a patient. I'm 25, have no kids (obviously), and went in for the consultation without my wife, and he only asked if she was aware that I was coming in so that he would know how to field questions should she come to the office asking about me. There was no grilling during the consultation. He asked if I wanted kids, said he was required to tell me to consider sperm banking, and that he's had some people actually make use of it, and then moved right along with the consultation. I was extremely satisfied with the procedure itself. I've had next to no pain following the surgery, and the staff has made sure to follow up with me about after care and to discuss any concerns I may have had. 

**Southhaven** 

[Dr. Alicia Wright](https://mogamd.com/provider/alicia-w-wright-md/) at MOGA in Memphis Tennessee and Southaven Mississippi. 901 843 1500 There are multiple addresses she rotates through in Memphis and Southaven. She is patient, kind, and VERY empathetic. There are many other doctors at the practices but I can't speak for them. The nurses on staff have always been understanding of my traumatic past as well. If anyone is a SA survivor, MOGA is the place to go.

Dr. Daniel Lee - MOGA. Bilateral salpingectomy. Great nurses, understanding & personable doctor, no pushback/dissuasion; large, clean facility; multiple locations, friendly staff, and lastly, no need for sterilization binder if seeing Dr. Lee! 

**Starkville** 

[Dr Sarah Rentrop, MD.](https://starkvilleurology.com/about-us/) She was SUPER nice and understanding of all my reasons. Didn't try to bingo me at all and was very respectful to my life views and beliefs. She scheduled the vasectomy for the next week. So I was sterilized with no-scapel vasectomy on February 7th 2023 and had 0 issues at all, just typical vasectomy recovery healing. My Medicare insurance covered all of the vasectomy, except I had to pay $63 dollars out of pocket ( I think the total bill was around $1000 or so dollars.)

Bisalpingectomy Cost: $0 My age: 28 Marital status: married Childfree status: Adamantly childfree. Said "you're old enough to decide whether you want to have children." Was given a surgery appointment the same day I requested the procedure. Bingos: None except a required acknowledgement that it is permanent.

I was open with her about being autistic and bisexual, I'm not sure if that was a factor or not in her saying yes so readily.

[Dr. Gretchen Stiefel](https://wha-inc.com/physicians/gretchen-stiefel/) with Women's Health Associates in Columbia, MO. Bilateral Salpingectomy First meeting with her (I had been with WHA, but my OB/GYN retired), expressed my desire for a BiSalp, she made sure I knew of my options as I already had an IUD, said it was just as reliable as permanent sterilization without the surgical risks, but did not try to dissuade me. I received a phone call later that day from the surgical scheduler and had my surgery planned. About me: 32, no children, married. Only questions asked were "You never want children? You understand this is permanent?" Day of surgery I was only asked once to confirm I had no change of heart. Would highly recommend anyone in the Columbia area to see Dr. Stiefel for their sterilization. Insurance covered the procedure 100%, though I do owe for the hospital expenses (anesthesia, nurses, recovery room, etc)

Claudia Nicholas Women’s Health Associates in Columbia, MO Performed a BiSalp on a 28 year old divorced woman, no children, one miscarriage.

[Dr. Mistie P. Mills](https://www.muhealth.org/doctors/mistie-mills-md?utm_source=google&utm_medium=location_listings&utm_campaign=yext_location) is absolutely amazing. She approved me for a bilateral salpingectomy on the first visit. I am 26F, married, no previous children and no plans of having any. She was very straightforward, explained the risks and benefits to me, and did not pressure or try to sway me in any way. Absolutely no bingos. All she wanted to know was that this was what I really wanted and she immediately scheduled me for surgery. I felt supported, heard, and respected the whole time. Surgery went wonderfully. 10/10 great experience.

Dr Sarah Bernard at Women's Health Associates/Boone Hospital in Columbia, MO. She performed a tubal ligation on me and didn't push back at all when I initially asked, plus the turnaround was super quick.

[Dr. Kirby Woodall, Columbia Missouri](https://www.muhealth.org/doctors/kirby-woodall-md). Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 34 y/o married woman. Very easy consult and procedure scheduling. I had a sterilization binder ready but didn't need it, she just asked a handful of questions and scheduled the procedure. No bingos and didn't make me feel uncomfortable or infantilized in any way. Missouri does make you sign paperwork and wait 30 days but I was prepared for that so no issues there.

Megan Carlson, DO, 1532 W 32nd St Suite 401, Joplin, MO 64804 Freeman Women's Healthcare Associates. Performed bilateral salpingectomy August of 2021. 25, single, no children. Was willing to preform the surgery due to age (25) and having already tried Nexplanon and Mirena IUD. Insurance covered full cost. Waited 3 months for operation after first appointment. NB this doctor may not be open to sterilising people who haven't already tried LARCs

[Dr Jack Tyrone Adcock](http://www.cfwjoplin.com/) at Care for Women Joplin in Joplin, Missouri. I was 20 at the time. Dr. Adcock was willing to sterilize me because I have a septum in my uterus and IBD, and had already tried a Nexplanon and IUD. I don't know if he would have sterilized me without my serious health conditions. He repeatedly told me that if I changed my mind I could do IVF. He also requested a letter from my primary care stating that I knew a bilateral salpingectomy was irreversible and I was mentally competent. While Dr. Adcock did make me jump through several hoops, he was the only doctor I could find within a hundred miles willing to perform a bilateral salpingectomy on me when I was 20. I paid nothing for the surgery with my insurance. This doctor could be difficult to deal with and we encourage members who have other options to pursue these first. 

**Jefferson City** 

Sarah Dunn with Capital Region Physicians, performed bilateral salpingectomy on 24 yo female, no kids. "She said she would do it at my first appointment as long as I had a one month follow up with her to confirm I wanted the surgery". Dr Dunn's nurse has contacted us to advise, "She has completed Bilateral Salpingectomies on a lot women throughout the years who have been unmarried and without children. The only requirement that she has is that you have to be 21, Medicare requires you to be 21, patients have ti sign a form confirming they are over 21 and are aware that this is permanent. She also requires that they come in twice, once for a consult and then a follow up a month later just to make sure they haven’t changed their mind and then we schedule surgery. The youngest patient we have had was 21 and she was child free. Our phone number is 573-632-5510, address is 1125 Madison Street, Jefferson City, Missouri 65101."

Dr. Sheila Carnett at Capital Regions in Jefferson City will absolutely support you and preform the procedure. I was 24 when she performed my bilateral salpingectomy and it was so easy! I basically walked in her office and told her I wanted it done and she scheduled it right away. She asked a few questions and whatnot, but she didn’t give me any hassle.

[Dr. Austin Findley](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/ob-gyn/faculty/austin-findley-md-mscr-facog.html) KU Medical Center: (913) 588-1227. Approved 29/F unmarried CF woman for bilateral salpingectomy. Only questions asked were to ensure I understood the procedure's permanence and the inherent risks of surgery, and that I was sure this is what I wanted. Made a point of affirming that I'm an adult capable of determining what's best for myself.

[Dr. Madhuri Reddy](http://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine/ob-gyn/faculty/madhuri-reddy-md-facog.html) KU Medical Center: (913) 588-9200. Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. Approved 28/F unmarried woman. Never asked about me having a partner. Approved over Zoom appointment during pandemic. Mentioned she's wary on doing it on patients under 25 with no children. Asked me what I would do if I hypothetically regretted my decision later. I told her in that unlikely event that I would adopt because I believe a lot of people have children they can't take care of who long for a home. She asked me why I wanted this and I said that it's something I've wanted since I was old enough to know better. That I wanted my decision as an adult to not want to procreate to be taken as seriously as people take a 16 year old who says she wants to keep her baby. Approved me right after that. Extremely nice and never asked "are your sure?" Even right before the surgery, just asked how I was feeling. Really felt like she took what I was saying seriously and never made me feel like I didn't know what I wanted.

She approved me immediately, no psych eval, 24 y/o married woman. Doctor is childfree herself and was wonderfully supportive and excited to hear about this community and wanted to be on the list. Doing a bilateral salp, not tubal- due to lower cancer rates

+1 Dr West, I (27F, no kids, no partner) had a bilateral salpingectomy done late September after seeing Dr Tracia West at Northland Obstetrics and Gynecology for the first time for a routine OBGYN visit mid-July. No bingos, just the usual questions to make sure I know it's permanent/irreversible and that no one has co-erced me to come in and ask for sterilization, stuff like that. Everyone was so kind and caring during the whole thing, no nurses bingo'd me either!

+1 Dr. Tracia West. She didn't need any convincing on why I wanted to be sterilized (bilateral salpingectomy). She immediately agreed, and just wanted to make sure that I knew what it would mean. She didn't even ask about my partner. She told me that she was going on call to help people get sterilized faster, after the Roe v. Wade thing went down.

Dr Laura Wolfe from Northland Womens Health located in North Kansas City/Liberty, MO. Liberty and North KC. This facility has an all female staff. In 2019 I was 24yo. I had spent 4 years looking for one that would do it. Found her. She requested a 6 month call back window from me just to confirm it all. Yes she knew I had been searching for someone. She just had to say ill give you 6 months, as long as you call within the next 6 months, we can have you on the table in 2 weeks. Since it was my first appointment with her, I couldn't do much more in that initial appointment, that's why the 6 months call was requested to set up that following appointment. 3 weeks later I sat recovering at home on the weekend. She actually burned my tubes away as her comment of "when you know you don't want kids, I make it happen without asking personal questions" She only gave me the basic run down questions for health needs and then the run through of surgical procedures/potential issues. I still see her for my yearly and will continue to do so for any future lady needs.

[Dr. Jackie Werner](https://www.nkch.org/find-a-provider/profile/jackie-l-werner-obstetrics-and-gynecology) at NKC Hospital. No bingos whatsoever by her and her staff, amazing bedside manner, just reiterated that it's permanent but that "it's always a person bearing a uterus's choice on what to do with their body, and I'm just here to make that happen". Also mentioned that she only does IUD insertion with anesthetic because she sees no reason to make people suffer and said that I was by no means the youngest person she's given a bisalp to because I'm an adult and can make my own decisions. She's absolutely the best doctor I have ever had, barring none.

[Dr. Rebecca Hamel Kansas City MO](https://doctors.saintlukeskc.org/provider/Rebecca+J+Hamel/1458331). Performed bisalp on 40 year old married child free female. Did not ask that my husband be with me at appointment. She is the best doctor I’ve ever interacted with of any specialty. She is very pro- whatever a woman wants. She wears an IUD on her name tag. She explained everything without making it seem like she was questioning my choice. Very supportive and just covered the basic ramifications of permanent vs other long term options for birth control. Cannot recommend enough.

[Dr Sara Reynolds at University Health in KC, MO](https://providerdirectory.universityhealthkc.org/provider/Sara+Reynolds/2238371). I am 27, married, childfree, and I had a Hysterectomy with bisalp. When I first asked her about sterilization in 2021, I wasn't quite ready to move forward, but wanted to see what my options were. She addressed all of my concerns and told me right away if I came back to her office and said I'm sure I want to do it, she'll sterilize me. I ended up with a full hysto because of a large fibroid that made it medically necessary regardless.

Performed a tubal ligation on a single 27 year old woman with no children.   Dr. Pearl only asked if I was sure this was the decision I wanted to make for my body before approving me for surgery. When asked if she had any hesitation due to my age she responded that it was not her place to decide what I do to my body and that my age didn't matter. I asked her if she would be comfortable being added to this list and she said she would love to be added so other women can get the medical care they need. Doctor's Statement: "I am an OBGYN. I offer bilateral salpingectomy to child free patients over the age of 21. LGBTQ friendly: I offer hysterectomies to trans patients and manage pregnancies for transmen, lesbian, and surrogates to male partners. The office accepts Missouri Medicaid and most private insurance carriers.”

-1 "I went in for a bilateral salp and endometriosis care consultation. She kept pushing birth control on me as first line treatment for both not wanting kids and to treat the endometriosis after I told her multiple times I did not want to go that route. Then she threatens to cancel the surgery since 'I’m clearly not comfortable with the surgery' even though my only problem was her repeatedly insisting on inserting an IUD during the bilateral salp. I talked with her manager which was no help, she only talked her up as the best doctor and only offered to “chat” with her about the ordeal. I’m now set to see a different doctor but now I have to wait another 2 months to do so. She also had zero bedside manner and ignored some of the things I said."

He was able to give me my consultation within a month of my call, and he scheduled me out for one month. During the appointment, I went in ready to come in and have to defend myself and my choices and he stated "You don't need to do that, you're an adult and know what you want, so I have no reason to prevent you from making your own decisions. I'm just here to help you. " it was extremely simple, and he made the process so comfortable. With insurance, I paid 576 in full (paying in full gives a 15% discount). 0 bingoes, 0 push back.

[Dr. Emily Sammons](https://www.usaobgyn.com/providers/emily-sammons-md/) of Heartland Women’s Healthcare as an OBGYN who does tubal salpingectomy with no questions asked really. I am in my very early 30s and went in to ask to have my tubes removed and she said okay. She said it was my choice to do it regardless of having children before or having a man sign off. The only time she is a little more hesitant is if some one is 19/20 coming in asking for it but she isn’t opposed. She did point out you can technically get pregnant through IVF. She can only perform the surgery out of Progress West Hospital as SSM is a religious hospital and won’t allow the surgery. It took about two months to get the surgery. Progress West has some block surgery schedule and the procedure needs to be squeezed in. I had the surgery a few weeks ago and have recovered. 10/10.

+1 Dr. David Eisenberg. He approved me (25F, single, no kids) for a bilateral salpingectomy without hesitation or having met me before. He also knew to code the procedure such that it would not cost me a fortune. Extremely kind and respectful. I had surgery the next month.

+1 Dr. Eisenberg did a bilateral salpingectomy for me as a 26 y/o, unmarried, CF, female. At no point did I ever feel like I didn't have strong support from the team. They made it clear what was being told to me because MO requires them to say it.

[Dr Alampur V. Kumari, MD](https://www.mercy.net/doctor/alampur-v-kumari-md/) - I can't say enough great things about her. The only questions she really had were to once again discuss sterilization vs a vasectomy for my partner and the procedure risks. She also took the time to explain each sterilization procedure she performed, and I had my surgery just about a month after that consultation. Also, she diagnosed me with endo, removed the endo tissue present, and dealt with an ovarian cyst during the procedure. Her office number is 314-567-8273, and it take a couple of calls to get the initial appointment. I don't have any children, I am unmarried, and I'm in my late 20s and neither doctor had any issues with that.

Asim Razzaq, MD Urology of St. Louis. Got vasectomy at 24 and had no push back. All he asked is if I had kids and I said no and that I never wanted one. He asked if I was sure. I said yes.

[Dr. Melissa Tepe](https://affiniahealthcare.org/providers/our-providers-lemp/) in St. Louis, MO. She was very friendly, never questioned my (28F) reasons for wanting to be sterilized, and firmly believes women should have final say in what we do with our bodies.

I am a 31yo AFAB queer/trans person with no children and no desire for any. She gave a thorough consult without a billion questions about "what ifs"- instead it was all "do you understand this procedure is permanent, do you understand risks of anesthesia, are you sure." And I got approved in my first visit with her. Very queer/trans affirming. Works in the same office as Gillian Schivone, another doctor on this list.

[Dr. James Hobby](https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/james-hobby-42a8e1f2-93e3-4a51-ad34-9f2d13e259d9-overview). 4251 Forest Park Ave Saint Louis, Missouri, 63108. 24F, Single/Never married, Childfree/Never pregnant.

Barbara Wotherspoon Mercy Clinic 1965 S Fremont Ave #270, Springfield, MO 65804 (417)820-3890 : Agreed to sterilize me the first time I asked. Didn't question me, she just scheduled the procedure. I know she does the Essure procedure, but I'm not sure about any other procedures. She is an excellent doctor who also doesn't have children (though I don't think she is necessarily childfree). She is extremely professional and believes that women should have control over their body no matter their age or reproductive history.

Dr. Geoffery Stanczyk, Mercy Smith Glynn Callaway Clinic, willing to sterilize 29F with no kids via tubal ligation with clips. Does not do bilateral salpingectomy procedure. Procedure has to be performed at Cox Surgery Center due to Mercy's Catholic philosophies against birth control, so check coverage with your insurance.

[Dr. Megan Christine Rooney](https://doctors.coxhealth.com/provider/Megan+Christine+Rooney/913286) 1000 East Primrose Street, Suite 210 Springfield, Missouri (417). Body-positive, no judgement for overweight or obese patients. 28, not married, I hadn't been to a gynecologist since I was 17 due to lack of insurance. Today (2/22/22) was my first appointment with Dr. Rooney. When I scheduled my appointment, I made it clear I wanted to discuss sterilization options. She performs bilateral salpingectomies and informed me of what the procedure consists of and said it's a permanent form of birth control and said that her nurse will call me on Thursday to schedule the surgery. I told her I was fully expecting to fight for the procedure, and she simply stated that if a patient of hers wants to be sterilized, it's her job to inform them about the procedure and complete it- not to dictate whether or not they want kids. Overall was an extremely good experience, and I definitely recommend Dr. Rooney for anyone in the Springfield area!

+1 Dr Rooney, I am 33 years old with no kids, and she was SO supportive! No bingo'ing or asking about future regrets. Scheduled for surgery the same day as consult. Fantastic experience!

+1 Dr Rooney, I have been waiting since I was 12 to have my uterus removed. She wasn't pressuring me, she allowed me to tell my story, and went through the options, and recommended based off of my health and history I chose the hysterectomy. The office ladies were super nice, however because that office does do obstretrics there are baby photos and someone might just be surround by pregnant people. I couldn't recommend Danielle Rooney enough. I called they were able to set up appointments right away, they always called back in a timely manner. I just have to sing their praises.

+1 Dr. Rooney, Jan 2023. Bisalp on 26-year-old redditor. She didn't question my decision, and I felt no judgment during the process. I am 5' (152 cm) and 250 lbs (113 kg), so I am considered obese, but weight was never brought up as an issue. She explained the surgery (bisalp) and ensured that I was aware the procedure was permanent. My surgery was scheduled about 3 months out (not a requirement, just the soonest availability), but I was able to get it moved up by over a month by calling to check for cancellations nearly every day. They remembered my name from calling so often and followed up when a cancellation came up. I felt supported by every staff member I interacted with throughout the entire process.

Dr. Kirsten M. McDaniel, DO. & Marcy E. Haley, WHNP. Winghaven Women's Care Inc @ Progress West Hospital (BJC System). 20 Progress Point Parkway, Suite 200 O'Fallon, MO 63368. (636) 928-4884. Agreed to sterilize upon first mention. Refers to procedure as a tubal, but states that more often now they remove entire tube due to effectiveness &amp;amp; reduction of cancer risk. Did ask if absolutely sure, but no argument afterwards. **MUST NOTE:** More willing to sterilize someone such as myself who is in their 30s, with a stable life & relationship, *BUT* admits that though she thinks still a bit young, some women in their 20s DO know what they want & are firm in their decision. SO basically not 100% CF, but not 100% anti-CF either.

**O'fallon** 

Cory Miller, MD 20 Progress Point Pkwy, O'Fallon, MO 63368. (636) 344-1073 Very easy to talk to, believes in patient autonomy and is willing sterilize anyone over 21, state law doesn't permit him to do so to women under 21.

[Dr. Kyla Carlson](http://www.billings-obgyn.com) - Billings OBGYN

+1 Dr. Carlson - bisalp on 33-year-old redditor. She did her due diligence in asking a few times if I was SURE about it, but never once gave any pushback.

Dr. Sironi - Billings OBGYN (salpingectomy on a 21 year old)

Dr Nicole Mandala - bilateral salpingectomy. I was 33 at the time, no kids, no partner, no issues - I was scared because I thought I would have to fight to get it done but she was so nice and almost as excited as I was. NB update 18 May 2022 Dr Mandala may have ceased practice at Billings. 

**Bozeman** 

Dr. Claire Putnam - this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise that "she is currently focusing her practice on helping women get sterilizations and birth control who need them" and can be reached via [phone call](https://shehealthmt.com/contact/).  

**Butte**

Dr. Susan Marik - https://www.sclhealth.org/find-a-doctor/m/marik-susan-a/ 406-496-3627  *Dr. Marik was originally in Spartanburg, SC, but moved as of August 2020.

**Helena**

Dr. Jennifer Duroy currently at Helena OB/GYN. Bilateral Salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Jessica Parsons, Helena OB/GYN](https://obgynoffices.com/), Helena, Montana. Bilateral salpingectomy, I'm 37, married, childfree. Dr. Parsons asked a few questions about why I wanted to be sterilized and to make sure I wasn't being coerced. She claimed there is a higher rate of regret among women under 30, so I got the sense the process would have been more difficult if I were younger.

**Great Falls** 

Melissa Papp, MD at the Benefis Women's Health Center in Great Falls, Montana. https://www.benefis.org/services-specialties/womens-childrens/womens-health/womens-health-services. Phone: (406) 731-8017. Friendly and direct doctor who didn't even look at my binder before agreeing to schedule me for a bilateral salpingectomy. Asked her if she was okay being listed on this list and she agreed as she firmly feels that women have the right to make that decision regardless of age and if they've ever had children.

[Dr Julia Middleton](https://greatfallsobgyn.com/about-us/dr-julia-middleton/) in Great Falls MT. Tubal ligation. 

**Missoula**

Dr. Jennifer Mayo - Western Montana Clinic - http://www.westernmontanaclinic.com/ - 406-721-5600. I just wanted to give a bit more information about one of the doctors (...), Dr. Mayo in Montana approved me for a Bilateral Salpingectomy at 22, and is very friendly and personable.

[Nicole Muskett](https://www.bluemountainclinic.org/) at Blue Mountain Women's Health Clinic and [Dr. Robert Humble](https://www.westernmontanaclinic.com/robert-humble-md) with Western Montana Clinic. I am 28, identify as female, and am engaged. Nicole didn't ask any questions before giving me a referral to Dr. Humble. During my consultation, he asked the basic questions and was able to schedule me a month out with no issues. Didn't even ask about marital status, just made sure I wasn't being coerced into it. Did not need to bring a binder at all. He and his team took great care of me!

+1 Dr Humble, He performed a bisalp on me, 31F, single, and childfree. Wait time was less than one month after consult. No bingos; he made clear that he trusted me (and CF women generally) and was asking questions about my reasoning to prepare a thorough narrative so that hospital and insurance would approve surgery. The hospital handled insurance prior authorization before scheduling. Hospital staff were wonderful; no bingos there either. 10/10.

+1 Dr Humble, who sterilised a 26F with bilateral salpingectomy. 

+1 to Dr. Humble at Western Montana Clinic. The first thing he ever said to me was "Don't see kids in your future, huh?" and proceeded to ask me some very reasonable questions. His team also helped me through some insurance confusion. Super helpful and supportive through the whole thing, and everyone I interacted with through the entire process was absolutely fantastic.

Kathy at, ironically, The Birth Center (https://www.thebirthcentermissoula.com/) who was my PCP due to physical distance. When I brought it up, she just confirmed that I knew it was a permanent form of birth control and that that was what I wanted. She also made a point to tell me to come back if I got any pushback from my referral so they could refer me to someone else.

Dr Amethyst Smith Located in Missoula, MT. She was amazing and basically told me she trusts women coming through her door to know their minds and bodies about being childfree. While I personally am older (almost 40) she indicated she’s happy to do the surgery for women who are much younger so long as they are educated about the procedure and clearly adamant about being childfree.

[Dr. Molly Johnson](https://www.chihealth.com/en/find-a-provider/provider-details.physician.58196e13-1430-49ce-a6b1-0dec0bc3d6e9.html) - Grand Island Clinic 2444 W Faidley Ave, Grand Island, NE 68803 308-382-1100. Doctor reached out to us to advise, "appy to perform tubal sterilization procedure for anyone who does not want any children (or any more children)!"

[Dr. Jill Fish](https://www.obgynnebraska.com/) in Grand Island, NE. I'm a married 28F. Dr. Fish question my motives or doubt my judgement, just verbalized that it's permanent and got it scheduled! I waited about a month and a half to get an initial appointment and then it was another month before we could do the surgery due to schedules.

**Kearney**

[Dr. Messbarger MD](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-robert-messbarger-296wp). Vasectomy 23, married, no kids Waited 2 months (1 month before rescheduling). TriCare was accepted and brought cost down to $83 out of pocket due before procedure. No bingos, though he did want to ensure that we both knew that this procedure should be considered permanent and was very respectable about it.

**Lincoln** 

[Dr. Jessica Sandmeier Lincoln OB/GYN](https://www.lincolnobgyn.com). Bilateral Salpingectomy, 20, single, no kids. Asked me why I wanted a bisalp at the young age of 20. Heard some of my reasons. I explained my bad experience with birth control and that I had a waiting period of 3 years debating sterilization. Asked me if I knew it was permanent. The doctor stated that the number one complication with the procedure is regret. Explained some details about the bisalp to me. Scheduled me for surgery to occur later that month at the end of one consultant at a surgical hospital in town.

[Meghan Bokemper](https://www.bryanhealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/meghen-bokemper/). Lincoln Nebraska. Age: 28 Marital Status: Married Procedure: bilateral salpingectomy. Dr. Bokemper was very professional. She just explained to me the options of birth control and the risks associated with surgery. She never asked why I didn't want kids or anything like that. Would highly reccomend her

-1 Dr Bokemper, I absolutely DO NOT recommend her. I have generations of health and genetic diseases, stage IV endometriosis, fibroids, and ovarian cysts, and she made me jump through so many hoops to get approval for a hysterectomy back in 2018. She forced me to reach out to a therapist and psychiatrist, neither of which I was even seeing at the time. Forced me to start birth control. Which I did not want. Told me that the ONLY WAY I could be approved for surgery was if I got letters of approval from a therapist, psychiatrist, my primary care physician, and my endocrinologist. And two months later after doing everything she asked me to do, she told me she was refusing to do surgery on someone unmarried, without children, and that I would be lucky to find anyone in the Lincoln area who would be willing to do one either. 

[Dr. Gregory Heidrick](https://www.lincolnobgyn.com) in Lincoln, Nebraska. I am 30 years old with no children. I scheduled my initial appointment with Dr. Heidrick and we discussed my options. When I told him I wanted my Fallopian tubes completely removed he told me the risks and reiterated that it’s 100% permanent. He asked me 3 times if I was completely sure of my decision. When I said I was, he didn’t ask me any invasive questions. He just scheduled me for my pre-op appointments and then got the surgery scheduled. The day of the surgery he checked one last time that I was sure and then did the surgery. He was kind, supportive, and I’m healing great from my surgery.

[Dr. Chandra Ljunggren.](https://www.lincolnobgyn.com/) Performed Hysterectomy and Bilateral Salpingectomy with minimal questions on single 27F. I, the patient, struggled with hormonal bc methods, discovered I had fibroids, and expressed a desire to be sterilized to my doctor. She didn't bingo me for my age, only asked if I was sure, as this procedure was permanent. Just had my surgery yesterday, but the lingering pain is 1000% worth it!

+1 Dr Ljunggren, 25, partial hysterectomy and Dr. Ljunggren was phenomenal. She listened to me and my concerns. She understood why I wanted to be sterilized and understood that living with endometriosis was awful.

[Dr. James Maly, MD, FACOG - Women's Clinic of Lincoln](http://www.womensclinicoflincoln.com/) - 402-434-3370 Performed a hysterectomy on my at age 20 in 2011 for extreme periods and a negative reaction to birth control. Didn't ask me one question about kids. Do NOT see his APRN. Just the doctor.

+1 Dr Maly, tubal ligation 22F. The ARPN is NOT childfree friendly but the office requires patients to see the ARPN before seeing the doctor. "But he’s a really wonderful doctor in my experience, happy to answer questions, respectful of my body during exams, and generally listens to me as a patient. Just a super nice guy."

[Dr Alyssa Rutan, MD Lincoln, NE](https://www.bryanhealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/alyssa-rutan/). Dr Rutan saw me (31F, married, no kids) for a consultation on a bisalp (she does not do tubal ligations), and the only questions she asked was a very quick series of "Is this what YOU want? And you know it's permanent? And you won't ever change your mind?" She then proceeded to tell me about the operation, kindly answered all of my questions, and asked me which day of the week I prefer. My surgery was scheduled within 2 months of my consultation. She even let me keep surgery photos. Highly recommended!

**Hastings**

Dr. Tyler Adam, MD (http://www.obgynnebraska.com/) - Bilateral salpingectomy - no judgement, no questions asked.

[Doctor Kristi NewMeyer](https://www.chihealth.com/en/find-a-provider/kristi-newmyer-md-facog.html) CHI Health Bergman Mercy Hospital in Ralston Nebraska, She just did a tubal ligation for me at 22, single, no children and no major preexisting conditions. All she did was ask me to write a letter stating my reasons and had me send it to her. Wonderful provider and I hope she can help others

**Omaha**

[Dr Tana Perry](https://providers.bestcare.org/provider/Tana+F.+Perry/1493600#provider-details-about), Council Bluffs, Iowa and Omaha, NE. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I perform bilateral salpingectomies on patients including in their 20s. I will document that my patient is aware of alternatives and that this is a permanent procedure. Some insurances require a wait period of 30 days but otherwise most patients able to be scheduled within 2-4 weeks (about how far I book out for OR time) . I accept most insurances including medicaid from both Iowa and Nebraska."  

+1 Dr. Perry. Dec 2022 - Bisalp on 23-year-old redditor. 

[Dr. Stephanie Harris](https://providers.bestcare.org/provider/Stephanie+M.+Harris/2121231) - Bilateral Salpingectomy, 28 (approved for surgery at 27), engaged, childfree. Dr. Harris was amazing. No bingos, just wanted to make sure I was informed and set on my decision.

[Dr. Sarah Gernhart, MD via OBGYN](http://www.mpcobgyn.com/physicians/meet-our-physicians/sarah-gernhart/), link to general [Contact Info](https://www.mpcobgyn.com/contact/) for Methodist Women's Center. (Essure &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Tubal Ligation) 

Dr. Brian Karre and his office is Methodist Indian Hills office, he operates at the Methodist Women's Hospital. He does essure and tubals. (gave tubal to 24F)

Dr. Sonya Tran, MD, Mid-City OB/GYN - ok'd married 28F for a bilateral salpingectomy after a consultation.  She said BSs are the main procedure she does and she never asked for my reasons!  

+1 Dr Tran, She did my (31/F) bilateral salpingectomy. I have no children and I am single and she started the process for me with my insurance after one consult. Highly recommend her.

[Jodanne (Jodi) Hedrick, D.O.](http://midcityobgyn.com/) - Mid-City OBGYN (402) 397-6600 - Did not ask questions other than "are you sure this is what you want?"  No judgement, she said the youngest female she sterilized was 22 years old, unmarried, no kids.

Dr. Christopher Deibert, MD.  Mutiple locations, seen at [Lauritzen Outpatient Center](https://www.nebraskamed.com/nebraska-medical-center/lauritzen-outpatient-center).  (402)-559-4292 - Required a consult, but only asked why I wanted a vasectomy, early-20s single male.  Gave no resistance to the surgery.  

[Dr. Erin Evans](https://awhomaha.com/about-us/erin-h-evans-md.php). I was 33 at the time, now 35 - no complications, no pushback, complete trust, transparency, and support. I was completely prepared with a list of why I didn’t want to have kids but she didn’t even ask for it. She had a couple questions and reaffirmed that I did not want them, gave me options for if I changed my mind but said that I’m past the age group where regret usually occurs, and then laid me down, told me about the surgery, and sent a nurse in to schedule it. She performed the surgery. Day of just one confirmation that I was sure and then boom. Done. Follow up amazing. She truly made it effortless and was transparent and supportive the whole way through!

###NEVADA

**Las Vegas** 

[Dr. Ernest Sussman MD Urologist](https://lasvegasvasectomy.com/), Vasectomy with cauterization and clips. Great bedside manner with a calm laid-back personality. One-on-one consultation for about 15 minutes, simply asks if you have children with no push-back or bingos. Has been doing this for nearly 30 years, procedure was about 20 minutes and mostly pain-free (aside initial numbing and stitches). Talks during the procedure to help calm you and explain what he's doing, and even texts the next day to check in with you. Only operates on Friday/Saturday, and doesn't accept insurance ($75 for consultation, $750 for procedure). Consultation and procedure can be booked online, got seen right at appointment time, and was given paperwork for Quest Diagnostics to have a sperm count done after a few months. Overall great experience, would recommend.

[Dr. Joel Abbott Pacific West Urology](https://www.pacificwesturology.com/) 6110 Elton Ave Las Vegas, NV 89107. I had my vasectomy done here on June 8, 2022. Dr. Abbott and his team are top tier professionals, and not judgemental in the slightest.

Annette Mays, MD of Las Vegas All Women’s Healthcare - laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation completed in October 2020. I was 35, divorced, and no children or pregnancies. I requested the BTL in July 2020. Dr. Mays agreed with no resistance due to my age and having had plenty of opportunity to have kids if I’d wanted them. She said she would have had “more of a discussion” if I was younger, but I think she still would have been open to it.

[Dr Amy Rosenbaum, DO and Kord Strebel, MD](http://whasn.com/locations/whasn-central/), Women's Health Assoc. of S. Nevada - Central.  Low hassle full salping-oophorectomy and hysterectomy. Mainly made sure I knew all of the consequences (menopause). Takes Silversummit Medicaid. 

[Dr. Lawrence Newman](http://www.newmanurology.com/), Newman Urology. No hassle vasectomy approval.

[Dr. Raul Romero-Joseph](https://smalv.com/), Southwest Medical Associates. No hassle Essure, IUD's

[Dr. Robert Gatlin](http://www.nevadawomenscare.com/), Nevada Women's Care. Essure, Tubal, and IUD's.

Dr. Kelsea R Farrell and Dr. Jyoti Desai at UNLV Medical Center, bilateral salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Jennifer Wong](https://www.lasvegasgynsurgery.com/). Bilateral salpingectomy. 42F, domestic partner w/ CF male, both CF. I had no pushback, no bingos at all from Dr. Wong about my desire to have a bisalp. Was in-network with my insurance, paid $458 at the surgery center and various other copays for visits and pre-op clearance procedures (EKG, chest x-ray, blood tests). Scheduled 1.5 months before procedure. She has performed them on people as young as 25, but wouldn't on anyone under 21. As long as the patient understands and accepts the risks and fact that IVF would be necessary if they changed their mind later, she has no issues with it and won't question what someone wants for themselves. I told her I was mostly asking this for people like myself, who know they absolutely do not want children and have often faced misogynistic pushback about permanent birth control. Again, the ages she listed and accepting the risks and what it means. She also mentioned having performed a hysterectomy on a perfectly healthy 33 year old who wanted one after I told her that I was asking for vehemently childfree people like myself.

NP Sheila Tack - will ONLY discuss sterilisation with people over 35, do not use this practitioner if under 35. 

Stepanida Freeman (Henderson) -  Empowered OBGYN. 31 years old, married (to a woman), no children. I expressed my desire to have a hysterectomy and that I have wanted one for about 13 years. I did have to be proactive about scheduling. Dr. Freeman is great. She actually listens to you. She does have a very thick accent so sometimes she can be hard to understand, but she's a great doctor. At first when I said I wanted a hysterectomy I was worried she was going to give me the run around like all my previous doctors because she is very hard to read, but she was on board from the start. She did a great job with the surgery, I was out of the OR and awake in 2 hours.

**North Las Vegas** 

Dr. Mark G. Henderson - Tubal, Endometriosis, Ablation. Not explicitly CF-friendly but made sure I knew it was permanent and agreed to do the procedure (he was under the impression that I was 26 when I was actually 36.) Not reluctant to do tubal but suggested hubby have vasectomy so I didn't have to undergo surgery. Has a bit of an odd personality. You will be required to sign a form stating that you understand sterilization is permanent.

**Reno** 

[Dr. Staci Paul](http://www.obgynreno.com/our-doctors.php), OB/GYN Associates - Instantly agreed to give me (30 yr old) a bilateral salpingectomy. I have no children. The instant I brought it up, she was on my side about it. No bingos, no attitude, no additional requirements. When I gave her my reasons (not that I was prompted) -- with the most important being that I simply didn't want kids -- she didn't question me in the slightest. Really pleasant person and a surprisingly no-hassle experience and quick agreement for the procedure.

+1 Dr Paul, completed a bilateral salpingectomy for a 25yo but presented a lot of bingoes. You need to work hard and prepare rebuttals to bingoes to convince this doctor if you are younger than 30. 
 
Dr. Iolanda Edsall -OB/GYN Associates I adore Dr. Edsall. I was 22 when she agreed to do my bilateral salpingectomy. I had just turned 23 once I got the surgery. She didn't once question me when I told her I wanted the surgery. During my consultation she said, "bottom line is that you know your own body." She seemed to really take her time answering my questions. She even asked if I wanted her to talk to my unsupportive family and reassure them this was my choice. The staff was also supportive.

[Dr. Angelo Kanellos, MD](https://urologynevada.com/our-physicians/#kanellos). 5560 Kietzke Lane, Reno Nevada 89511 (Washoe county) (775)322-7811.  Procedure: no-scalpel vasectomy with fascial interposition, cauterization and metal clips. Age - 23, Marital status: Single, Children: 0 and childfree. Summary: No bingos! Consultation and procedure on the same day. Appointment scheduled more than a month away due to COVID. Waited less than 15 minutes after I arrived. Fully covered by Prominence health plan. I paid a total of $70 total for copays. 

[Dr. Holly T. Ashley Cothern](https://www.saintmarysreno.com/find-a-provider/holly-t-ashley-cothern-md/), 236 W 6th St. UNIT 303 Reno, NV, 89503 (Washoe County)
(775)337-8400. Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24, Single and childfree. Instantly agreed to do the surgery before asking me any questions. No bingos. Went in for birth control implant removal and bisalp consultation, came out with a date for the procedure, two months away due to COVID. Completely covered by the ACA and my insurance (PEBP Healthscope) although I was bille, and had to call my insurance and get claims processed correctly. The hospital required I make some form of payment the day of the procedure, I paid just $50 and nothing more. Dr. Ashley has 19 years of experience and there were no complications.

**Henderson** 

Dr. Keith Brill - he is part of Women’s Health Associates of Southern Nevada (WHASN) Dr. Brill talked to me and asked me a couple of questions such as “You understand this procedure is permanent?” “Do you have anything going on that may affect your ability to make decisions?” etc. He said “Listen. You are an adult and you are clearly capable of making your own decisions for your own life and health. As long as you understand the risks and the permanence of this procedure, I have no reason to deny you.” He even disclosed he had done this procedure for women as young as 21. My OR team was fantastic. Before I knew it I was waking up in recovery and preparing to go home. There are some reviews online that say Dr. Brill ‘seems to not have any time for his patients’ or ‘rushes through appointments’ but that was not my experience. If anything, I liked his efficiency. He’s kind, informative, and has a good sense of humor as well. And the nurses and OR team he works with at Henderson Hospital are all awesome, as well. I had a great experience overall. Absolutely would recommend.

Dr Elena Langdon - She will push for other options but she will do a salpingectomy. She's Russian. Very to the point and blunt. The staff are super supportive. 

Doctor Scott Baranoff from Las Vegas Urology in Henderson 9053 S Pecos Rd Suite 2900, Henderson, NV 89074 - Vasectomy. 

[Dr. Hayat Jawadi](https://www.premierobgynlv.com/) Tube removal (apparently some amount of ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes so she recommended removal) performed August 2021. 36, no kids or pregnancies, never married. Dr Jawadi made the process so very easy ❤️

###NEW HAMPSHIRE

**Colebrook** 

[Dr Plociennik](https://avhnh.org/provider/krzysztof-z-plociennik-md-facog/). He did an endometrial ablation and a bilateral salpingectomy. I am 31 years old, unmarried and 100% childfree. He was kind and treated me like an adult with their own mind. His whole surgical team was wonderful, kind and supportive. I had a fantastic experience there. My insurance paid for the whole thing due to it being marketplace insurance.

**Concord** 

[Dr. Nicole Varasteh](https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider/provider/696/Nicole-N-Varasteh), Concord Hospital and Dartmouth Hitchcock Clinic. 31F, married, laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy Dr. Varasteh was wonderful from beginning to end! I had all my talking points ready for the consultation but didn't even need them. She listened to what I wanted done, made sure I was at least aware of other options and that the bi-salp is permanent, and when I said I was sure she said alright, let's get you on the schedule! She asked about my life, if i was married, had never wanted kids etc, but she never asked for my husband's opinion or anyone elses, just that I was sure of what I wanted. She gave me some pamphlets to get familiar with the procedure and sent me on my way. Come surgery day she was super personable and easy to talk to, and the whole care team was great. I felt well informed at every step and despite some general nerves, they all created a very soothing experience, and not a single bingo at any time. Can't recommend Dr. Varasteh and her team enough.

**Dover**

[Dr. Michael J. Michaels, MD](http://physicians.lahey.org/directory/profile.asp?setsize=10&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pict_id=0003445) Very Professional, no-hassle vasectomy.  Fun staff from start to finish.

[Dr. Anne Kalter](https://www.wdhospital.com/wdh/providers/anne-h-kalter-md) Highly recommend. She said she would perform sterilization on anyone of legal age. She prefers bilateral salpingectomy due to effectiveness and reduced risk of cancer, but will also do clips or rings. No questions asked, very kind and supportive. "It's your decision." 

+1 Dr Kalter, "Dr. Anne Kalter from Wentworth Health Partners OB/GYN and Infertility in Dover, NH did my bisalp and she was amazing. However, I got a letter from the practice earlier this month that she is retiring on February 1st, 2022."

**Lebanon** 

[Dr. Michael Ritondo, MD](https://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/findaprovider/provider/2864/Michael-E-Ritondo). I had a bilateral salpingectomy in June 2022, my age at time of surgery, 26, single, no other kids. He came in, introduced himself, asked what I was here for, I told him a salpingectomy, he said “I know how to do that, okay.” And was approved within 15 seconds of him coming into the room and hadn’t even sat down yet. He explained that IF I ever change my mind, I am still able to have children via in vitro. He did my pre-op the same day, himself as I have no other health concerns and do not take any medications. I was scheduled a few weeks later and I would do it again 10x with him! Phenomenal doctor!

[Dr. Brenna Stapp](https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/brenna-stapp-do-7610c0c2-c731-4e57-b5dd-dc235edcafc7-overview). Manchester Obstetrics & Gynecology Associates, Tubal Ligation/Tube removal. Super professional and kind. Very supportive, not judgmental. Friend was 23/no kids and I'm 28/three pregnancies/no kids, and it was no questions asked for both of us. Surgery scheduled for less than a month after consultation. Highly recommend.

+1 Dr Stapp, am very happy to say that I (37F, married, childfree) went through a successful bilateral salpingectomy 3 days ago. My surgeon was Dr. Brenna Stapp of Manchester, NH USA. She and everyone at her office were very supportive from the moment I first walked into her office: surgery happened one month later. 100% recommend

+1 Dr Stapp I’m 26F and just got a bilateral salpingectomy done by Dr. Brenna Stapp at Manchester OBGYN in Manchester NH (she’s already on the list and is how I found her) just wanted to add another case, I’m single and she gave me the surgery with basically no questions asked. She’s incredibly respectful and never even prodded when I gave my reasoning for sterilization being that I didn’t want children. I also want to add that she does IUD insertion with a cervical block (it’s so rare to find gynos who will provide adequate pain care so I feel this would be helpful to add)

Dr. Jillian Dulac. She's an MD at Manchester OBGYN. The address is 150 Tarrytown Rd, Manchester, NH 03103. I'm 23, no kids and not married. Highly recommend! Tubal ligation.

[Morgan Jenkins](https://monadnockobgyn.squarespace.com/morgan-jenkins), MD Peterborough, NH Monadnock Ob/Gyn Associates. "I do laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomies.

**Nashua**

[Dr. Karen Flaherty, APRN](https://www.snhhealth.org/find-a-doctor/karen-flaherty) Actually, the entire practice is friendly. [Women's Care of Nashua](http://www.womencareob.org/?id=714&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sid=41). Very supportive in IUD process, no judgement. Cooperative scheduling. LGBTQ+ friendly and body-positive. 

+1 Women's Care of Nashua - I’m happy to report that they are just as wonderful with regards to sterilization as they are with IUDs.

**Portsmouth** 

Harbor Women's Health [Dr. Caroline Scoones, MD] (https://harbourwomenshealth.com/) Everyone I've talked to is so nice and supportive. Dr. Scoones was very understanding and didn't question my decision. 

[Melissa A. McGann, DO](https://www.wdhospital.org/wdh/providers/melissa-a-mcgann-do). This doctor has reached out via social media to advise, "For anyone looking for or interested in reliable long acting reversible contraception (IUD, Nexplanon), I’d HIGHLY encourage you to see a gynecolgist soon because they are coming for those next. For anyone interested in sterilization, I am happy to help. To any woman certain you do not want children- I will gladly have a consultation with you for sterilization as long as you’re an adult and are competent to understand the counseling given. I don’t require you to have had any children, get the blessing of a partner, or be any age other than what is required by the state of New Hampshire. You are your own person and can make that choice. Please reach out to me and I will personally get you into my schedule and if I can’t I will help you find you a doctor in time. All confidential, no questions asked, ever.”

**Whitefield** 

[Julie Hohmeister](https://weeksmedical.org/staff/julie-hohmeister-aprn-whnp-c/) She did a physical and agreed to refer me for a bilateral salpingectomy as well as a laparoscopic surgery to look for endo. She was a fantastic listener and a very gentle person. She treated me like an adult and with respect. All she did was make sure I knew it was permanent and even told me I didn't need to explain my reasons to her because I was a grown woman. Cannot recommend her enough.

###NEW JERSEY

**Bordentown** 

Dr Stephanie Schwartz-Kravatz, MD is a wonderful Dr located at capital health in Bordentown NJ and Langhorne PA. Upon my first visit, she did not question my choice to be sterilized, she only gave me a quick warning that I might experience regret later on. I thanked her and she made a consultation appointment for the surgery. As well, the pap smear was pain-free and she made the whole experience as comfortable as possible. 10/10.

[Robert Goldlust, M.D.](https://www.summithealth.com/doctors/robert-w-goldlust-md). Vasectomy. 25, have a partner, doctor knew I was childfree. Dr. Goldlust was great. When I went in for a consultation, he asked if I had any kids. When I replied that I didn’t have any, he stated that he is usually hesitant to perform a vasectomy on someone so young and without kids. After I assured him that I thought long and hard about my decision, I was able to schedule a surgery date. Just make sure you have your reasons/resolve ready. Was very pleasant on the day of the procedure.

**Browns Mills** 

[Dr. Mark D. Kuhn](https://www.capitalhealth.org/find-doctor/kuhn-mark-d), Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24F, married, no kids. Had absolutely 0 issues with my request, said that he believes in my right to make this choice for myself. Longest wait was for them to call me to set up a surgery date. First appointment was June 14th, sterilized on July 19th. I have Tricare prime and had no issues or pushback with them covering 100% of the cost for any of the appointments and pre-op labs. Also just a great bedside manner which helped with my anxiety before surgery.

**Cherry Hill** 

Dr. Luisa Galdi, but everyone I have encountered at that location was very accommodating and friendly. I had no issues getting a hysterectomy scheduled and done, despite only being 27. I don't know if this is a caveat, but my reasons were partially due to gender dysphoria, so I do not know if cis women may have more trouble, but I doubt it. Additionally, Virtua Health accepts state Medicaid plans (Horizon NJ Health I know, others I am unsure of) so depending on your income you may be able to get surgery at little to no cost!

**Clifton** 

Dr. Mubashir Shabil Billah, Clifton, New Jersey Urology. Addr: 6 Brighton Road, Suite 108, Clifton NJ 07012 Tel: 973 873 7000 Operating rooms are at Hackensack NJ 30, single Their questions/comments, why?, any kids?, ok cool, see my scheduler. Scheduled within 3 weeks after consultation.

**Clinton**

[Dr Randy Klein, MD](https://www.thedoctorisin.net/personnel/personnel/randy-klein/) Offers in-office vasectomies. Requires a prior consult appointment. Asks minimal questions (Why don't you want kids? What would you do.... basically, don't sound like an idiot. Have good answers ready) Dr has performed vasectomy on as young as 23 with openly no children and single. 

**Denville** 

[Doctor Zimmerman - Morris Urology.](https://www.gsunj.com/physicians/gregg-zimmerman.htm) Denville and Mine Hill. Professional and respectful discussion about getting a vasectomy. No pressing on reasons, just a complete explanation of the procedure and making sure I was certain it was what I wanted.

**East Brunswick** 

Dr Uzoma Owunna, MD, FACOG Office: Axia Women's Health Location: East Brunswick, NJ Procedure Performed: bilateral salpingectomy. Performed at age 29. When I inquired about the procedure, her agreement was so rapid that I was at a loss for words, fully ready to argue my case and still receive a no. She told me the medical industry has an unfortunate history of being patriarchal, but she insisted it was not her or any other doctor's right to decide for their patients, and that she was "happy to do this for me." A month after our first meeting I was fixed.

**Freehold** 

Andrew Blechman, MD-Meridian Health System, 3499 U.S. 9 North, #2b, Freehold, NJ 07728 - Went in for Essure but it didn't work so he tied my tubes in the same procedure. 

+1 Dr Blechman I am 24 years old and opted for a tubal ligation. He is doing it with no questions." 

+1 Dr Blechman Easily agreed to tubal at 22 years old. Said "You make your own decisions." Also actively suggested ablation without prompting. 

+1 Dr Blechman, I [27] went in for tubal/ablation to resolve fertility AND bleeding; no horrid questions, he let me know what to expect from ablation & what we'd do if it failed.

+1 Dr Blechman, I [22] booked a consult 6/5, and spoke with Dr. Blechman for about 20 minutes before I was approved with no pushback or bingos. He barely looked at the sterilization binder I prepared, and took me at my word. Scheduled and had my surgery on 7/11. Total cost with Aetna insurance was about $1.1k. Recovery has been smooth with overall 3/10 pain, some intermittent cramping, soreness in my stomach, and light aches from the gas.

**Hackensack** 

[Dr. David Shin, MD](https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/David+Shin/1319909). I [24 M] consulted about a vasectomy. Dr. Shin and his staff not only were very respectful but actually commended me about my reasoning for wanting to get the procedure done. Everyone was very friendly, the procedure was done in office and I didn't feel a thing. I have bipolar disorder so the only minor setback was I had to get assurance from my psychiatrist in a written letter declaring that I was of sound mind to make this decision which made sense. I definitely recommend him if you can get an appointment.

**Hammondtown** 

Ali Strochak, Bilateral Salpingectomy, just informed me that it's permanent and there are other options which could be just as effective. 

**Jersey City**

**Moorestown** 

[Dr. Bowers](https://axiawh.com/providers/bowers-geoffrey/). Complete robotic laparoscopic minimally invasive hysterectomy. 31F, single, completely CF. Dr. Bowers was absolutely incredible, I cannot recommend him highly enough. He was completely open to my request for sterilization from the first appointment. We discussed other options I had considered, and he stated that my personal autonomy and control of my own body was entirely up to me. The surgery was done outpatient on 8/8/22 at Virtua Voorhees. Everything was laparoscopic and robotic. He removed my uterus, Fallopian tubes, and cervix. Ovaries were left to control hormone regulation and bone/heart health. Recovery was a breeze all things considered, the only scarring I have is a small 1 inch incision above my belly button. 10/10 experience overall!

**Perth Amboy** 

[Dr. Aftab Husain MD](https://urologicsolutions.com/) - Urologist (office 1, performed vasectomy here) 663 Brace Ave, Perth Amboy, NJ 08861 (office 2) 1656 Oak Tree Rd Ste 3, Edison NJ, 08820 Phone: (732) 826-0059. Use this doctor with CAUTION as OP, who is childfree, has existing health concerns and is over 40 which factored into the doctor's decision. 

**Princeton**

[Dr. Sumra Tayebaly](https://obgyn.princetonmedicalgroup.com/our-physicians/sumra-tayebaly-md-facog/) Bilateral salpingectomy 26F, married, childfree She was totally respectful and didn't bingo me, just listened and agreed to do the surgery. She said that she typically suggests bisalps over tubals for her patients. She also said she wouldn't perform an ablation on someone my age because the risk of failure is higher if you're younger.

[Dr. Booher](https://www.princetongyn.com/?utm_source=gmb_auth), Women's Healthcare of Princeton (NJ). 31F, bilateral salpingectomy. Not a single person in the entire office challenged my decision or reasoning, starting with the tech, the nurse practitioner, scheduling assistant, or surgeon. They simply ensured my understanding that this is permanent and it's not my only option, but it's a valid choice to make if I want to proceed. Dr. Sophocles from this office also does ligation and salpingectomy.

+1 Dr. Sophocles, Women's Healthcare of Princeton. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor. 5 weeks from initial appt to surgery. I know my experience was a lot of luck and living in a blue state, however not once was I bingoed and everyone from first consult to in the hospital was so amazingly nice and supportive.

**Secaucus** 

[Paul Mackoul](https://innovativegyn.com/paul-mackoul/), performed a partial Salpingectomy on me [single 24F]. had a phone consultation and most of the pre-op paperwork was online. No hassle or pushback at all.

**Sewell**

[Doctor Kathleen Schaeffer](https://www.cooperhealth.org/doctors/kathleen-schaeffer-do) in Sewell & Camden NJ. 23/(M)ftm. Received a complete robotic laparoscopic hysterectomy about a month after I asked for it, no questions about wanting children, no hassle over my age. She was just concerned about me receiving the best care possible and being comfortable after my procedure.

**Somerville**

[Dr. Keith Harmon MD, FACS](http://somerseturological.com/) Somerset Urological Associates, 72 West End Avenue, Somerville, NJ 08876, (908) 927-0300. Sept 2022. Vasectomy on redditor in his early 30s. "He didn’t hassle me at all. He treated me very well, I felt respected, he had a sense of humor, and I felt quite comfortable with him. He knew I was in my early 30s, and he didn’t try to make me think I don’t know what I’m talking about."

**Sparta** 

Dr. Matthew Hall - Sparta health and wellness, skylands urology. (https://www.skylandsurology.com/matthew-hall.html) No hassle or bingos. went in, told to mull it over for 2 months. 2 months later i was snipped! At 25! No issues at all, extremely professional.

[Dr Anandhi Nadarajah](https://findmyamgdoctor.atlantichealth.org/provider/Anandhi+Nadarajah/640419?name=Anandhi%20Nadarajah&sort=networks%2Crelevance&from=search-list) - removed my tubes 2 weeks ago and today at our follow-up appointment expressed interest in being added to your list. She's willing to sterilize young women should they ask.

**Summit** 

[Audrey A. Romero, MD](https://findadoctor.atlantichealth.org/provider/Audrey+A+Romero/642458). Bilateral salpingectomy. 26F, single, no children, CF. I recommend Dr. Romero; she’s my gynecologist and during my annual, I asked for permanent sterilization options. She was hesitant as I was single and 25 at the time, and asked me if I was completely sure, and if I wanted to try other birth control methods. After I confirmed I was positive, I had to wait about 6 months until I had the procedure. Insurance covered everything, including the post-op appointment. She even showed me the photos of the procedure per my request.

**Tinton Falls**

Dr. Dana Jacoby, 41 N Gilbert St, Tinton Falls. Gave me a tubal at 22. It took a lot of convincing, he wasn't comfortable doing it on someone so young but eventually he agreed. You'd have an easier time if you're late 20s or older but may be worth a shot if you're younger.

###NEW MEXICO

**Alamogordo**

[Dr. Scott Shin](https://www.gcrmc.org/family-medicine-residency-program/about-us-2/faculty-staff/scott-shin-do-facog/) at Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center. I'm CF and was sent to him when I was going through an ectopic pregnancy. After taking care of the issue he asked if I wanted another IUD and I asked about sterilization. When I told him that we have no kids and don't want any he said "I respect your decision." He gave me my bi-salp in Jan 2019 and still works here.

**Santa Fe** 

[Dr Sheila Cepeda](http://www.stvin.org/sheila-cepeda-md), Christus St. Vincent Women's Care Specialists, Santa Fe, NM 505.984.0303. NB this doctor has since moved to Farmington. 

**Las Cruces** 

Dr. Rebecca Coalson, 2930 Hillrise Dr #2, Las Cruces, NM 88011. (575) 521-1889 She is willing to do Essure for me as long as I'm 100% certain. She didn't ask me why I don't want kids, and said she has performed Essure for CF women before. Very nice and considerate. 

**Albuquerque** 

Jennifer Gil MD - (505) 823-8787. She's under the Presbyterian Health Network in Albuquerque, NM. I'm a 27 yo unmarried person with no previous pregnancies and no other condnditions that might make me a candidate for sterilization. I had one video appointment with my PCP who referred me to her and I had one in person appointment with Dr. Gil before being approved for a bilateral salpingectomy. She did not try to persuade me otherwise, only explained the procedure and asked for my reasoning behind choosing sterilization over other methods of birth control which was primarily for health insurance reasons. I have Presbyterian Health insurance and they covered 100% of costs associated with the surgery.

Dr. Alana Williams, Women's Pelvic Specialty Care Clinic at Lovelace Women's Hospital. Performed laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 

+1 Dr Williams - Performed bilateral salpingectomy on a second redditor, aged 22, and told her she has done them on patients as young as 21. She told this woman that she was an adult and could make decisions for herself, and did not have to be persuaded, or give bingos or pushback. 

+1 Dr Williams approved a 27 year for a bisalp. No pushback or bingos and very supportive of bodily autonomy. 

+1 Dr Williams approved me for my bilateral salpingectomy at 21.

+1 Dr Williams bilateral salpingectomy 27F, she listened to my choice and understands the choice to be sterilized without judgment or "Bingos". She feels that adult women have the right to choose what they do with their bodies.

+1 Dr Williams. Total hysterectomy (removal of uterus and fallopian tubes). After nearly 12 years of searching for a doctor would take me seriously I took a chance and booked an appointment with her back in 2021. Upon meeting Dr. Williams she was extremely kind, caring and supportive. I had originally mentioned being interested in uterine ablation but we both decided a hysterectomy would be better due to having extremely painful periods (uterine ablation could make that worse) She never once made me feel uncomfortable, incompetent, or selfish for not wanting children. The appointment took all of 30ish minutes. 

[Dr. Katherine Schwartz](https://wsnm.org/providers/katherine-schwarz-md/), Women's Specialists of New Mexico. Approved 27-year-old for bisalp with no bingos.

+1 Dr. Katherine Schwarz, Women's Specialists of New Mexico. Approved a 21YO with no children for a bisalp with no bingos at the first meeting and performed the bisalp at the first available surgery timeslot in Aug '22. Declined to perform an endo ablation or a partial hysterectomy due to my own major medical risk factors.

[Dr. Jamie Krashin](https://findadoc.health.unm.edu/FADPF/Home/Details/%23001H295QB), I am 23F, single and had my consultation and bi-salp performed by Dr. Krashin. My consultation involved her confirming I was sure I didn’t want biological children and to tell her a bit about it, explaining my options to me, and booking my surgery date. She was so calm and respectful. She never asked about my family or whether I had a partner, only about me and what I wanted and was comfortable with. She thoroughly explained and even drew out what each option would entail. Anything she told me was informational and not opinion.

+1 Dr Karshin, Dr. Jamie Karshin did my pre-op (bi-salp). I am a 28 year old. I have a partner but we aren't married. No bingo, just the standard question they have to ask before they can the procedure. She said they have an age limit of 21, and she said she would do one for anyone over that, as long as they are positive. Dr Karshin did have to refer OP to another practitioner as they are booked out but the other practitioner was also supportive. 

+1 Jamie Krashin. I'm 29 years old, and had my consult and my surgery (bisalp) done by Dr. Krashin. She was super respectful of my choices and my reasoning behind them, and never mentioned my partner. She gave a lot of information on various types of sterilization and non-sterilization birth control, but never tried to lead me one way or another, just wanted to give me as much information as possible. She also agreed to let me keep my IUD for period management. As a side note, all the staff at the UNM Center for Reproductive Health with Dr. Krashin were were respectful and positive about people making their own choices.

[Dr. Jessie Simmon](https://lovelace.com/doctors/jessie-simmon-md) at Lovelace Medical Group in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am a transgender man who does not want biological children, or any children as of now. When I explained my reasons for wanting to have my reproductive organs removed, Dr. Simmon was very understanding and explained things very well. I do not know if I would call this a bingo but she only stated once: "You're positive you don't want to have kids, and you know this isn't reversible, yes? Still want to do it?" When I responded that I was sure, she did not ask again and we continued on with getting me set up for the procedure.

**Farmington** 

[Dr. Mark Fisher, Southwest Obstetrics & Gynecology](http://www.southwest-obgyn.net). Very kind and considerate. Approved laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy without any bingos and without questioning my decision not to have kids. 100% supportive with the best bedside manner of any doctor I've ever encountered. 

**Rio Rancho** 

[Dr Claire Herrick](https://pmgdirectory.phs.org/details/1177/claire-herrick-obstetrics_and_gynecology_womens_care-rio_rancho?FreeText%3aProvider+name=Herrick OB/GYN). My surgery was performed here: 2400 Unser Blvd SE Presbyterian Rust Medical Center Suite 28400 Rio Rancho, New Mexico USA 87124. Total hysterectomy (she took my uterus, fallopian tubes, and cervix, I kept my ovaries) completed on 3/3/2022. 25 F, single, completely child free, now and forever! Dr. Herrick is an incredible woman. She was the first gyno I talked to about having a hysterectomy, and was completely supportive of it from the start. She understood that this is something I've wanted for years, but she wanted to be completely sure I wasn't going to change my mind, so she asked me to wait 6 months and check in with her every 2 months, just to confirm. I respect the hell out of her for this. I'm lucky I was able to find a doctor who values my sanity over saving my uterus which was causing my insane amounts of pain. She's an absolute sweetheart, and 100% cares about her patients and wants to do whatever she can to help. (Even called my insurance when there was a mess up to set things straight so we could get the procedure done before my 26th birthday since I'll be off my mom's insurance).

+1 Dr. Herrick  - Bisalp on 28 year old woman who says: I loved that she was careful to make sure this was what I wanted but never tried to contest anything I said or wanted. While she admitted she would have been a bit more hesitant if I was coming purely from a place of fear, she was perfectly happy to go through with the procedure once I listed out what I want from life, my set of mental health challenges that I don't want to to pass on, and the fact that I have been seeing a therapist who respects my decision and would have been happy to talk to her. Age never came up in the conversation. 

**Socorro** 

[Harold Frederick Baskin, MD](https://pmgdirectory.phs.org/details/519/harold-baskin-obstetrics_and_gynecology_womens_care-socorro). Bilateral salpingectomy (minilaparotomy, not laparoscopic). Dr. Baskin agreed to sterilize me after several other doctors at the practice refused. He was open to performing a bilateral salpingectomy, but was not comfortable using a laparoscope, so the procedure involved minilaparotomy and salpingectomy (a ~2.5 inch incision and the manual removal of ~3/4 of each fallopian tube, with care taken to remove the fimbriae entirely). This resulted in a longer recovery time and more post-operative pain than a laparoscopic procedure would have, but the surgery was done with great care and without complications. All costs were covered by Medicaid.

###NEW YORK 

**Albany** 

[Dr. Christopher Bloss](http://www.communitycare.com/Physicians/Profile?ProviderID=651) - Said he believes more in autonomy than his personal ethical views. Was willing to schedule and perform sterilization.

[Dr. Peter Cole](http://www.amc.edu/Departments/obgyn/index.cfm)  at Obstetrics and Gynecology at Albany Medical Center. Has been my doctor for my entire adult life and is just all around wonderful.  When I requested to be sterilized, he said he believed in body autonomy and didn't question my decision.  Amazing bedside manner!

[Dr. Robert Welliver - Albany Med Urology](http://www.amc.edu/PhysicianDirectory/index.cfm?event=showPhysicianDetail&amp;amp;PRACT_ID=13539) - 23 Hackett Blvd, MC 208, Albany, NY 12208. Was super chill when we went in to talk about my fiancé getting a vasectomy. No bingos, no belittling, simply asked if we were cool remaining childless and moved on to discuss scheduling. Provides his vasectomy patients with script for Valium for nerves. Doc had a very pleasant, relaxing bedside manner and allowed me to sit in on the procedure as well. Had a resident assisting, so procedure was very quick and easy.

Dr. Mark White, Vasectomy. https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/pnisu3/recommendation_for_dr_mark_white_for_vasectomy_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

[Dr Alexandra Burke in Latham](https://www.communitycare.com/Practices/CommunityCareObstetricsGynecologyMidwifery/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 33, unmarried but have a partner, childfree. A great experience from original conversation with my gyno (a NP midwife in the practice, Julie Washington, who I also recommend; she urged me to get my tubes out if I was feeling ready for it!) to the consult for the surgery. Dr Burke was nonchalant in the best way about my sterilization and treated it as commonplace as getting dental work! My desire to do this was never questioned by her or her team. I did get some concern raised by my anesthesiologist ("All this for that? You didn't try birth control?!") but I'm overall really happy with the support I got. She also checked for endometriosis at the same time and ended up removing a cyst.

Dr. Corrinne McCleod 391 Myrtle Ave Suite 2, Albany, NY 12208. I had a 2 page list of all my reasons for wanting sterilization and I never had to give her any of them! She agreed immediately and only asked me questions that were relevant to my medical history and the surgery. I'm 33, unmarried, child free, obese, and have some chronic health issues. I don't think she would turn down younger patients either because I told her I've been asking gynecologists since I was 19 years old for this (but they all said I'd change my mind and was too young) and she agreed that was wrong it should've been my choice.

[Dr. Sylvia Sossner](https://www.amc.edu/PhysicianDirectory/index.cfm?event=showPhysicianDetail&PRACT_ID=4840) has been my OBGYN for the last 6 years. I brought up the idea of sterilization at my first visit with her, at the age of 26, and there were no bingos, just well worded questions to make sure I understood what I was asking for, knew the alternative birth control options, and that I was asking of my own free will. For financial, time, and career reasons, I wasn’t ready for the procedure right away, but she followed up with me every year to see where my head was at. And each time I said I still wanted to be sterilized once my career was in a place where I had good health benefits and sick leave allowance. That all finally came together at the age of 33. The most complicated part was securing a surgery date due to upcoming travel I had and the scheduler taking some PTO. I am confident I would have had the procedure within weeks of consultation otherwise.

[Dr. Humera Syeda](https://www.newloudonobgyn.com/). Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 35, single, childfree. Initially brought it up when I was ~30 and she would have done it then, but I was not ready to have elective surgery when I already had an IUD; chose sterilization after the Roe vs. Wade stuff. I believe she would be willing to perform it on any age, but I did not ask until I was 30+. Casually asked me a couple questions to make sure I was sure ("What if you meet someone who wants kids?" "Then we aren't compatible" "Okay good"). Said she has more young women getting the procedure now.

[Dr. Susan Pesci, MD](https://www.montefiore.org/doctors/profiles/1801110788/Susan-E-Pesci) Montefiore Medical Park at Eastchester, 1695 Eastchester Road, Bronx, NY 10461-2374, 718-405-8200. LBGTQ+ friendly. Bisalp on CF redditor Dec. 2022. 

**Buffalo**

[Dr. Christopher J. Skomra](https://www.wnyurology.com/about/providers.aspx). Scalpel vasectomy with local anesthesia. I am 25M/white, unmarried & no children. It cost me $10 but I have very good health insurance, the practice accepts most insurances. In my consultation with Dr. Skomra he asked me why I was there and if I ever wanted to have children, upon telling him my answers he told me that he performs vasectomies regularly and they should not be treated as reversible (as reversals are not 100% guaranteed to work.) No BINGO, no questions other than what I do for work (for recovery recommendations.) The practice scheduled me for 5 weeks from the consult and it went flawlessly, I had a next day return to office/5 day return to physical labor.

[Dr. Suzette LaJeunesse](https://www.buffalomedicalgroup.com/staff/suzette-lajeunesse-m-d/)  at Buffalo Medical Group - Bilateral Salpingectomy - She does full tube removal as it is the preferred method in the field - No BINGO'ing just nice and simple. Do NOT seek out the services of this doctor if you are under 25. She will refuse you. 

[Dr David Lillie](http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-david-lillie-2rlkh) - No scalpel vasectomy

[Dr. Joseph M. Greco](http://www.wnyurology.com/)

[Dr. Judith Ortman-Nabi](https://www.gppconline.com/judith-ortman-nabi-md-facog) - Dr. Nabi did not bingo me at all which is crazy because I am 18, nulliparous, have never used any method of BC and I've never been sexually active.  She asked about my history with birth control and if I've ever been sexually active.  Dr. Nabi's method of sterilization is bilateral salpingectomy.  

+1 Dr Nabi, I got a bilateral salpingectomy. I am 21, unmarried and child free. Never have been pregnant. They accepted my insurance (Fidelis Medicaid). She was lovely, no bingo and said yes after a short convo. The initial appointment i had to wait a few weeks for. Also had to wait a month for the surgery (mandatory for NYS) but that was nothing more than inconvenient. Had the surgery two weeks ago and it was such an easy and quick process. Healing the first day was miserable but after that it was smooth. You will definitely need someone to help care for you. She is retiring next year, so keep that in mind.

+1 Dr Nabi, I am 26 year old single nulliparous woman. Although it was my first appointment with the practice, they got me in pretty quick for a sterilization consultation (although normal checkup appointments with Dr Nabi are booked a year out). Dr Nabi performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on me a month later at Millard Fillmore Suburban. She did not bingo me even once. Her and the entire team that worked on me was extremely considerate and I was provided excellent care in her office and at the hospital.

+1 Dr Nabi, bilateral salpingectomy 20F

Dr. Magda Osman of the Buffalo Medical Group to the CF friendly doctors list. She completed a bilateral salpingectomy for me (31F, married, no kids) on 10/24/22 in Buffalo, NY. I was not bingo'd, but she tried recommending an IUD as a non-permanent alternative. When I said I wanted surgery, she was very understanding and we were able to schedule the surgery within a month. My insurance covered most of the procedure, I just had a $100 copay.

[Dr. Taylor Johnson](https://www.ogawny.com/providers/taylor-johnson-md/), I'm f22 and have been trying to get my tubes tied for about three years now so this was huge for me. (She had joined the office in 2021). No BINGO's and I'm going through with scheduling a bisalp for 1-2 months from now. I heard about her through my friend who is looking to get gender affirmation surgery, which she was willing to do as well as understanding of them. She also had recommended treatment for my vaginismus that no other doctor of mine brought up that even existed. She was very open and I felt listened to.

**Catskill** 

[Jonas G. Wilson-Leedy, MD](https://www.columbiamemorialhealth.org/doctors/jonas-g-wilson-leedy-md/ Catskill/Hudson, New York). Bilateral salpingectomy; open to removing ovaries, uterus, etc. if sensible due to cancer history or relevant issues. Age 28, single and never sexually active, childfree. It was a genuinely positive meeting and discussion regarding sterilization. He went through the normal list of birth control options and surgery risks and such, but very clearly wasn't pushing them and was simply fully informing me. He noted that I seemed resolved early on, and was 100% bingo-free even though I'm a slightly unusual case (28, virgin, admitted I might never become sexually active but that sterilization was worth the peace of mind). Spent more time discussing what options would or would not help me with periods than anything else, chef's kiss. I was a new patient so a few week's wait for my initial check-up appointment, at which point I asked to discuss sterilization and I got the appointment to meet with the doctor a few weeks later. Scheduled the surgery in the first available slot just over a month away, noting some insurances want the 30-day wait but that he was booked up until then anyway. Delightful experience, highly recommend.

**Corning** 

Dr Elizabeth Gordon - 23, bilateral salpingectomy, needs 2 appts a few months apart as a cooldown. 

Guthrie Hospital, NY, 27, hysterectomy with:

**East Amherst** 

Dr. Ashley Conway with Trinity Medical OBGYN in East Amherst, NY. I am 23F, unmarried (no boyfriend either), and no kids. Right from the start of my appointment, she fully respected my decision and supported me as soon as I brought it up. She had to ask me some bingo-y questions because they were insurance hoops to jump through, but that was the only reason why. Surgery was scheduled a month & a half after I saw her for the first time, and went incredibly smoothly. Would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone in the Buffalo/WNY area.

**East Setauket**

[Dr. Jennifer Blaber](https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/patientcare/obgyn/providers/jennifer-blaber) University Associates In Ob/Gyn, 140 Belle Mead Road, Suite E, East Setauket NY 11733, (631)444-4686. Jan 2023. Hysterectomy and bisalp on 31-year-old redditor. I went to Dr. Blaber to ask for an ablation to stop my periods since a hysterectomy is so invasive. She suggested a hysterectomy because I'm young enough that my periods would come back in a few years and the scar tissue would make it harder to detect cancer. There were no bingos and she immediately accepted that I didn't want to stop my period with hormones. She immediately set me up for all of the appointments I needed for testing and pre-op. I first saw her in September and just had the procedure last Monday. She spoke slowly, allowed me all the time I needed for questions, even answered the ones I felt silly asking. I never felt rushed or pressured and she's honestly the best provider I've ever had for anything.

**Fishkill** 

Dr. Rachel Schoenbrun (CareMount Medical in Fishkill/Poughkeepsie). After meeting me once she agreed to provide a bisalp and it was all set within a month. I'm 33, married, no kids and she was onboard even before giving me a new patient exam or anything. Not sure how much detail you need to get her on the list. I had the procedure on Tuesday 6/21 at Vassar Hospital and everyone was so kind to me. I couldn't be happier. 

**Geneva**

[Jennifer Lavanga](https://www.rochesterregional.org/physician-directory/l/lavanga-jennifer?y_source=1_ODE3MjY2NC03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D), MD 200 North St Ste 101, Geneva, NY 14456. Simply asked for sterilization on the first meeting with her. Said no problem, no bingos, no hassles. "Your body, your decision."

-1 Dr Lavanga, pushes IUD based on "new data," and is "moving away" from surgery based on it. Currently in their office and just got denied not even 5 minutes after she came into the room.

**Glens Falls** 

[Dr Diana Sustar](https://www.womenscareny.com/meet-our-providers/diana-sustar/) Bilateral Salpingectomy, 26, Married, never had any children. She’s a wonderful doctor, who actually listens to you. I had seen her since I was 21, however I had only brought up wanting sterilization this past June (2021), and she did it a little over a month later. No waiting, no bingos. She just asked simple questions to make sure that’s what I wanted, and told me that it’s my body and it’s her job to help me out with whatever I decide.

**Hudson**

[Dr. Edward Marici DO](https://www.columbiamemorialhealth.org/doctors/edward-marici-do/). 71 Prospect Ave, Medical Office Building, Suite 240, Hudson, NY 12534, 518-697-5467. April 2023. Bisalp on 34-year-old CF redditor. My meeting with him went great, he could tell I had done research on the procedure and after explaining the required stuff about how it's permanent etc, he agreed to do the surgery. I had been prepared to argue my case, but really didn't have to. He seems to be very good about explaining all the options and letting you decide what you want. Surgery was scheduled for little more than a month out. 

+1 Dr. Marici.2023. Dr. Edward Marici is FANTASTIC. He's all about quality of life and is great at answering any questions you have and making sure you feel comfortable and informed. I got a hysterectomy at 30 with him and would highly recommend him to anyone.

**Hudson Valley**

[Dr. Christine Beer](http://www.caremountmedical.com/directory/people/show/christine-beer/) I went in to discuss sterilization with her and told her I was sure at 29 that I do not want children. She suggested bilateral salpingectomy as it is her preferred method and said she does not perform Essure placement any longer. The initial visit and surgery could not have gone better. 

+1 Dr. Beer. Bisalp on 25-year-old redditor.Dr.  Christine Beer did my salpingectomy at 25, with a required second opinion from one of her colleagues who just asked, "So, any questions?"

**Huntington** 

Dr Gianni Rodriguez-Ayala in Huntington, NY (Long Island). I am childfree and had my bilateral salpingectomy performed in January 2021 at 32 years old. Dr Rodriguez asked if I wanted to try an IUD, and I said no, I was over it and wanted to be sterilized, and that was that! No pushback. Please add her to the list!

[Dr. Theodore Goldman](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/obstetrics-and-gynecology/dr-theodore-lyle-goldman-md-11354510?utm_source=provider_listing&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=doctor_dot_com). Bilateral Salpingectomy 23F. 

**Ithaca**

[Dr. Phaelon Silva - ObGyn Associates of Ithaca](http://www.ithacaobgyn.com/)

[Dr. Dvorah Milner, via consultation with her NP, Marie Harkins - a midwife focused on gynecology, not babies - CMA Women's Health](https://www.cayugamedicalassociates.org/womens-health/) Went in to learn more about the potential procedures, discussed everything *thoroughly* and went into technical detail when I wanted it. Approved for tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy (my choice) at 32 years old, no pregnancies ever. Harkins was very supportive and holistic, making sure to account for my overall health without questioning my choice. She was sympathetic to the judgment women who don't want children face. The local Planned Parenthood said this entire practice is very woman-focused and supportive, and I believe it. Strangely, a highly enjoyable consultation and cervical screening. 2019.

**Jamestown** 

[Dr. Andrea Walsh](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Andrea+Walsh/1323666). She said yes to my tubal, no questions asked!

**Johnson City** 

Dr. Michael Castello, DO practices with Upstate Urology of UHS, 30 Harrison Street S460, Wilson Square 13790. Agreed to preform vasectomy on 23 male, procedure was on at 24 due to delays with covid. Didnt get any bingos as he said i was an adult cableable of making my own decisions.

Krystal Thompson, MD Obstetrics & Gynecology, Women's Health, UHS Perinatal Center 33-57 Harrison Street Johnson City, NY 13790 607-763-6101. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy with cauterization. Single, female, 26 y/o, no children. I do have to warn that the office where she practices is a perinatal office. I am someone with tokophobia and it was hard to wait in a office with heavily pregnant women. The hallways are lined with photos of pregnant women, children/families. But, Dr. Thompson is an incredibly profesional and intelligent woman. There were no bingos, she believes in bodily autonomy. She only made sure that I was informed about the procedure, and the outcome. It was a 15 minute visit and she scheduled me for my pre-op at that visit. She is an lgbtq+ ally and POC.

**Latham** 

[Doctor Danielle Rooney of Community Care OBGYN](https://communitycare.com/practices/community-care-obgyn-midwifery/). Procedure performed: bilateral salpengectomy personal info: 23 year old woman, unmarried and no children short statement: I never once felt judged or experienced any bingos from anyone I interacted with at this office. Dr. Rooney herself was supportive of it being my choice, only asking once if I was positive of this decision, understood it would result in permanent sterilization, and that nobody was forcing me into it. The procedure itself was performed at Bellevue Women's Center, which I add because the only bingo I experienced during this process was from the (male) anesthesiologist there who came in prior to the procedure for consent (he was not the actual anesthesiologist for the procedure).

**Long Island**

[Julie Lian, MD.](https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/patientcare/obgyn/providers/julie-lian) Long Island, NY. Stony Brook Hospital. Laparoscopic partial hysterectomy (removal of uterus and cervix, ovaries left). I am 30, was 28 at surgery. Married with husband. Childfree personally and researcher. I went in requesting hysterectomy as I wanted to remove risk of pregnancy and menstruation. Dr. Lian said she would do it, though reluctantly. I brought my husband as I knew that would improve my chances, but she only asked if we discussed it and he was okay once. She emphasized the surgical risk and suggested an IUD, which we left to consider, but I returned still requesting the hysterectomy. She approved and by the end of the summer I had the surgery. There were appointments and checkups before the surgery, but no more consults about the decision.

[Dr. Brian McKenna](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/obstetrics-and-gynecology/dr-brian-patrick-mckenna-md-11360935?utm_source=provider_listing&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=doctor_dot_com) 3001 Expressway Drive North Suite 116 Islandia, New York, 11749 (631) 292-6747.  I (31) had a bilateral salpingectomy on December 14, 2015 with no issues. Actually it was the opposite he was all for it. I answered minimal questions and booked my surgery. 

+1 Dr. MeKenna. April 2023. Bisalp on 32-year-old redditor. Referred from a friend who had the procedure done July 2022 after finding this list. Received the procedure April 2023, just two months after my initial appointment. Experienced no judgement and was further informed that tying/cauterizing can lead to regrowth AND that 40% of ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tube so, (as far as I know) he solely does complete removal. A whole team including a certified anesthesiologist was present, and the staff were so sweet. Doctor called me the same evening to check in. Went above and beyond, letting me know how my uterus/ovaries/appendix looked.  The medical center is located in Riverhead, but it was worth the trek. Cannot recommend him highly enough.

[Dr. Jaspreet Joneja](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/urology/dr-jaspreet-singh-joneja-md-11366949) I [30M] had an initial appointment and answered some basic questions. I explained I do not want children and I do not have children. I scheduled the follow up and the vasectomy went very smoothly, less than 1 hour total. I would highly recommend this doctor!

**Middletown**

Michael Wilson, DO, GARNET HEALTH DOCTORS UROLOGY MIDDLETOWN 707 East Main Street Middletown, New York 10940. Phone: 845-333-7575. Summary: Took one visit to get approval. Asked me why I was sure, explained it was permanent, examined the "goods" and explained he would like to do it under sedation. Easy, but it was not a no-scalpel.

[Dr. Christian Roman-Rodriguez](https://www.crystalrunhealthcare.com/providers/christian-f-roman-rodriguez), who works in Middletown and Monroe, NY, USA. He works at Crystal Run Healthcare. I'm 28F unmarried/no kids, and when I told him I was interested in sterilization and started to explain why, he told me I didn't have to explain myself and gave me all the information about the procedure, made sure I understood it was permanent and irreversible, answered my questions and set up the surgery appointment. He was extremely kind, respectful and supportive, and said more than once how sorry he is about the state of reproductive health in America but that he would do whatever he could to make me feel comfortable and safe. Wonderful doctor.

+1 June 2022:  the whole experience has been wonderful (31F). 

**New York City**

Dr. Steven Sheng, 170 William St. Manhattan, NY. Can't recommend Dr. Sheng more! Not one bingo on a 30 year old childfree unmarried woman. He was also very supportive when telling him about my tokophobia. I got my bisalp recently and the procedure went well. Dr. Sheng was supportive and compassionate throughout the process.

[Dr. Alexandra Fleary](https://maidenlanemedical.com/profile/alexandra-fleary-md/) 18 East 41st Street, First Floor, New York, NY  10017, 646-290-9560. April 2023. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor. Doctor may not be supportive of younger redditors. Doctor was amazing, made it super easy, very supportive, didn't question my decisions at all. Seemed eager and happy to help when other docs would not have been so supportive. Did mention she may have questioned someone a lot younger, like 21, and encouraged them to wait a little bit to be sure.

[Dr. Susan Pesci, MD](https://www.montefiore.org/doctors/profiles/1801110788/Susan-E-Pesci) Montefiore Medical Park at Eastchester, 1695 Eastchester Road, Bronx, NY 10461-2374, 718-405-8200. LBGTQ+ friendly. Bisalp on CF redditor Dec. 2022. 

[Dr. Jill-Ann Swenson, MD, FACOG](https://maidenlanemedical.com/profile/jill-ann-swenson-md-facog/) Maiden Lane Medical 7206 Narrows Avenue Brooklyn, New York 11209,  646-290-9560. Bisalp on 32-year-old CF redditor.

[James A. Kashanian, M.D.](https://weillcornell.org/jakashanian), Vasectomy, 30, Single. No children. The doctor asked my relationship & parenthood status, but did not make any statements as to what I should do with my body. He recommends but does not require a fertility test for a baseline before the procedure in case of a desire for reversal. He was very respectful, the wait time was short (30 days by state law), very communicative, and answered questions readily before, during, and after the procedure. He was also willing to prescribe anti-anxiety medication for the operation.

[Dr. Julia Jaffe and Dr. Temitope Awosogba](https://www.gramercygynecology.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxb2XBhDBARIsAOjDZ36I21U16rdTQCpLBvIVVILOBT9Yc2nxCPQLDukXqqOWG_iDmGBbB_oaAn6aEALw_wcB). They are both doctors at Gramercy Gynecology and perform the surgery. I received a bilateral salpingectomy at age 26, single, childfree. The surgery was covered completely under Cigna OAP besides a $100 copayment, and nobody tried to discourage me. They only asked me the questions they are legally required to review with me and were otherwise neutral.

[Dr. Jin-Hee Kim](https://doctors.columbia.edu/us/ny/new-york/jin-hee-(jeannie)-kim-md-51-west-51st-street) in New York City - bilateral salpingectomy for 29yo CF. I had one virtual visit where I presented my desire and reasons to get sterilized. Not only did I want it, but I also had a blocked Fallopian tube & would have had to get that side taken out anyway - so I told her I wanted both. The only thing she asked me was "You know this is permanent?" & I said "Yes, but I also know I can have IVF if I ever changed my mind (unlikely)." She acknowledged that I had done my research, said yes, & went over some potential dates with me right then & there. Surgery went perfectly, & not once in the months leading up to the procedure did she try to bingo me or talk me out of it. 10/10 do recommend Dr. Kim.

[Dr. Alyssa Erb](https://nycgyne.com/team/alyssa-erb-d-o/), I do not have any kids and am 24 and have been officially sterilized yesterday by her. She is located in NYC. The insurance I had was Fidelis Care Medicaid managed care and everything was covered. I contacted them multiple times regarding this, as well as contacted my insurance to make sure. I have not been charged since I left the hospital.

+1 Dr Erb, 350 W 58th St – 1A New York, NY 10019 (347) 545-2520. They take a variety of health insurances. Lgbt friendly, and childfree friendly. They have 2 other locations in nyc as well. I had a bisalp, I'm 21, single and totally childfree. I had no bingos whatsoever, I was able to get it within 4 months of signing the paperwork in accordance to NY state laws, and I had no copay whatsoever. She was amazing no objections whatsoever she was very supportive. I would 100% recommend her, she was very thoughtful and thorough. Her bedside manner is wonderful and I felt like I was in good hands. Took into account my allergy to opiods and prescribed painkillers I'm not allergic to. She's lgbt friendly as well. She's been supportive of me getting a bisalp since I was 18 but my insurance denied it. 

+1 Dr Erb May 2023. Also Cohen Medical Group in general, whose doctors performed the surgery when Dr. Erb was not "in-network." Bisalp on 21-year-old redditor. Initial consult in Feb 2023. 

Dr. Adjoa Bucknor - The entire team at Cohen is amazing! I felt no push back and didn't even need a binder.

[Dr. Rochelle Joly](https://weillcornell.org/rochelle-joly-md) - Sterilized me in my 20s. Had one appt with her and she went over health history and okayed me. NY had/has a 30 day waiting period so I had to wait 30 days before the surgery. No kids. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Very kind doctor.

[Dr. Bobby B. Najari](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1952555781/bobby-b-najari)  He mentioned he's actually childfree himself while we were discussing my no scalpel vasectomy, so you couldn't ask for a more sympathetic visit.  During the procedure he was freakishly smooth...they warned that it wouldn't hurt but I might feel tugging, and I didn't even feel that.  It was as if nothing was happening at all.  Couldn't recommend him more highly.  Very personable and understanding, and makes sure to explain what he's doing so all expectations are clear along the way.

[Dr. Robert Berg](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1336105436/robert-e-berg) - Dr. Berg approved me for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy without batting an eye. In fact, he seemed surprised that I had to consult a few doctors before finding him.  Many reviews online say he has bad bedside manner, and handles his patients roughly, which I can agree with in a way. He is very matter-of-fact and during my physical exam he would touch me without much warning. He never crossed a boundary though, I just want to give people a heads up. He is a very pleasant person but I think he forgets to check in with patient's comfort levels. Also another warning, his office staff is pretty rude and impatient. However with all of the unpleasantness, the surgery went flawlessly. I am recovering without any complications and feel so much better off.

+1 Dr. Berg was absolutely delightful and put me at ease very quickly. He's funny and straightforward, won't waste time sugarcoating things. He has *no* problems sterilizing anyone as long as they know what they want and are of legal age. I had no problems with the rest of the office staff either, though I agree they can be short. I would 100% recommend that office. My surgery went well, and the OR staff assisting him said he's a brilliant surgeon and a great teacher. Well worth the wait!

+1 for Dr. Robert Berg @ NYU! I got a bilateral salpingectomy. 26 / single / no children. He was funny and straightforward (which I liked) and answered all my questions and approved me with no judgment, just the mandatory info! He’s also aware of this sub LOL. The office staff is indeed curt, but they definitely know what they’re doing. I had a smooth surgery experience & an extremely easy recovery, and I’m so happy I went to see Dr. Berg! Also, I’m on UHC and they didn’t cover it at 100% but I applied and got approved for charity care.

[Dr. David Weiner](http://www.columbiadoctors.org/prof/dmweiner), yes a urologist named Dr. Weiner.  Super-friendly, extremely informative.  At my vasectomy consultation, he asked how many children we have.  I considered lying, but told the truth anyway.  "Oh.  Do you guys travel a lot?"  Not as much as we'd like to, I responded.  "I just ask because a lot of the couples I do this for travel a lot and want to keep it that way."  That was it.  No judgment.  He said he does vasectomies for non-fathers all the time.  Great experience.

[Dr. Peter Wong](https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/peter-lap-kei-wong-do-104812) - Mott Women's Healthcare LLC. If you're under 30, haven't had any kids, and want a tubal ligation please be aware that you will have to pay a copay at each of the three visits (the three providers with whom you will meet are Dr. Angie Li, Dr. Edward Chan and, finally, Dr. Peter Wong, the DO) before they will schedule tubal ligation surgery as they want to make sure that you fully understand the procedure and its implications. They'll perform Essure, basically 'no questions asked', in office. Waiting times at this office are very long (1-2hrs) most days so bring work to do or a book to read.

[Dr. Jenny Reisner](https://www.springobgyn.com/) Bilateral salpingectomy. 35F, married, have known I didn't want children for as long as I can remember. I can't speak to how it would go for a younger person, Dr. Reisner were both totally non-judgmental and kind. Once they asked some questions to get to know me and make sure I understood my options (hey that's part of their job), they were 100% supportive of my choice of surgical sterilization. My surgery was done at NYU/Tisch and everyone there was terrific, too.

+1 Dr. Reisner. May 2023. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor.

Dr. Edward Zoltan - Brooklyn. I'm 30, unmarried and with no kids. He wasn't particularly a fan of my decision but it didn't take much. Scheduled for next month.

[Dr. Ivan Colon](https://nyhealth.com/people/dr-colon). 175 Ramsen St, Suite 1225, Brooklyn, New York, 11201 718-696-0186. Was referred to Dr. Colon via my primary care physician after requesting a vasectomy. Questions asked included that I understood the procedure was permanent and that I was 100% sure that I did not want children in the future. New York State 30 day waiting period after initial appointment was also required. Procedure was quick with 30 minutes under general anesthesia. Male, 24 yrs old, No Children

[Dr. Dana Gossett](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1467459099/dana-r-gossett) (referred bilateral salpingectomy for 30F, no kids) - great listener, didn't make me feel rushed with the information I felt I needed to tell her. Not once was I asked "are you sure?".

[Dr. Ronochelle Joly](https://weillcornell.org/rochelle-joly-md) I got referred to her, and after a consult she scheduled the bi-salp and put everything in motion. Very simple and direct process. And my experience at the hospital was fantastic, the staff were friendly, accommodating, and willing to answer all my questions. I loved the whole experience!

[Dr Danielle Gershon](https://www.doximity.com/pub/danielle-gershon-md-74ea8a1c) - The Bronx. "I perform the full spectrum of GYN care, including bilateral salpingectomies and abortions. I also insert LARC (implants and IUDs)."

[Dr Valerie Wells](https://uesgynecology.com/) "Dr. Wells has been my doctor for years and has known I don't want children, so getting a bisalp scheduled was a complete non-issue. No pre-op appointment (we discussed it at my annual) and she did the surgery. Really wonderful practice, very accepting of whatever path you want to take."

[Dr. Ximena Matamala](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1043323652/ximena-matamala) NYU Langone Ambulatory Care West Side 355 West 52nd Street, 5th Floor New York, New York 10019. I am 29, married, with no children. Dr. Matamala is amazing. She never questioned my desire to be sterilized, however she did require two meetings (the very first time I met her and told her I wanted to be sterilized, and a second meeting to confirm). Once the paperwork was signed for a bi-salp and we waited the legally required 30 days, it was very fast. Absolutely no wait time at the hospital. I got there, they got me set up, I went in and it was done. Everyone who worked with me was absolutely amazing and supportive. 

[Dr. Taraneh Shirazian](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1053432310/taraneh-shirazian). Bilateral salpingectomy (not yet completed, scheduled for 1/5/2022). Age: 32 Marital Status: Committed partnership Childfree Status: Very, VERY childfree. Experience: I met with Dr. Shirazian virtually, and I told her that I was looking to get a bilateral salpingectomy for primarily sterilization reasons, secondarily as a preventative measure (my paternal grandmother had ovarian cancer that killed her at 53). I explained that I never want to have kids and, the older I get, the more sure I am of my decision. She told me it was a very reasonable decision that I was more than capable of making for myself - not a bingo in sight. She scheduled a pre-op ultrasound to make sure there were no other issues to deal with pre-surgery, and she said I’ll unfortunately (her words) have to come in to sign paperwork at least 30 days before (NYS law), but that once that’s done they can schedule my surgery.

[Alfred Winkler](https://weillcornell.org/alfred-winkler-md) Weil Cornell Medical 646-962-9600. Procedure: Vasectomy (cauterized ends and tying). Age: 39 Marital Status: Single Kids: None. We had the conversation where he asked all the questions to make sure it was something I wanted to go through with. I didn't feel like he was trying to talk me out of it or anything, I felt as if he was just performing his due diligence with care. He had me wait two week before going into to sign the paperwork, from which point, I then had to wait the mandated month. My surgery was in August, and it went well - he and his assistant were just really pleasant and professional. FYI, his process included cauterizing AND tying the ends I was all healed up in 2 weeks and as of last week, I got the all zero sperm count all clear. My insurance was Blue Cross Blue Shield for those interested.

Dr.Melissa McHale mmchale@reproductiveimmunology.com. She was a wonderful doctor that explained all options and reviewed/answered every question and lab result. Never pushing any agenda except that she was there to support me in whatever decision I thought was best for my body. Currently, she is completing her surgical time in NY/NJ and will be moving to a practice in DC around May. She is willing to do elective surgery on in and out of network patients. At this time, she is willing to work with all insurance and won’t/does not make the patient responsible for paying the difference if the insurance covers less than cost of procedure.

No children, no health issues, had been his patient for a few years, was on oral contraceptives, and in a relationship with a man who had a vasectomy. Dr. Zolnik only said it was permanent and if she changed her mind, she'd likely have to try IVF. She said there was zero judgment, no attempt to convince her otherwise, and no request for a partner's permission or consent. He did ask if she knew about Essure, but she declined that option in favor of cauterizing her tubes with no issues.

[Dr. Amy Lai](https://jamaicahospital.org/clinical-services/ob-gyn/doctors/), 8906 135th St #6S, Jamaica, NY 11418. Agreed to perform tubal ligation (cauterize tubes) on 23 year old. First visit, I brought up sterilization, she asked if I knew it was permanent (I do), no further questions. Had to schedule a mandatory counseling session (about 10 minutes of paperwork) which is required for my insurance purposes.

**Nassau County**

[Dr.Teresita Santiago](https://www.ilovemygyn.com/providers/dr-teresita-santiago/). 25, unmarried, no kids. I brought my mom as an advocate in the event I experienced patronizing behavior or bingos, along with a binder. The binder actually seemed to annoy her because she felt like I was trying to educate her, so don’t bring a binder. I didn’t have to make a case, she simply wanted to stress that I need to give informed consent and that there is the possibility of regret.

[Dr. Seth Plancher] (http://www.gardencityobstetricsandgynecology.com/) Garden City OBGYN, 877 Stewart Ave #30, Garden City, NY 11530, (516) 222-1033 - Although I haven't actually had a tubal, when I inquired about sterilization during one of my yearly visits, he said sure. I even asked him, "Really? Even though I'm under 35 and have no kids?", and his response was basically, "Yeah, of course."  Total non-issue. This doctor also has wonderful bedside manner. I'm moving to Brooklyn this year, but as long as he's still in practice, I won't bother looking for a more conveniently located gyno. Doctors like him are a rare find, so I'll deal with the trip to Long Island.

[Northwell Health OB/GYN - A division of North Shore University Hospital](https://www.northwell.edu/doctors-offices/northwell-health-ob/gyn-services-at-the-irving-goldman-family-care-center). 865 Northern Boulevard, Suite 202. (516) 622-5202. Bilateral Salpingectomy. An outside doctor referred me to a doctor there who referred me to the clinic. Did a consult with the clinic. (If I remember correctly, surgery consults are only done on Thurs evenings.) Later, I got an appt for pre-surgery clearance and the surgery. I found out who I was assigned during the clearance appt. Everyone, day of surgery, had such great bedside manner.

The procedure completed: Bilateral Salpingectomy, 29F, married. Doctor agreed to a bisalp after asking at two separate annual visits. She will definitely be more lenient now. Covered 100% under insurance (EBCBS), with the exception of a $250 anesthesia fee. Surgery took 15-20 minutes, minimal recovery pain, has been smooth sailing since. Highly recommend.

[Dr. Dana Almeida](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/obstetrics-and-gynecology/dr-dana-michelle-almeida-do-11381953). She is from the same medical group as Dr. McNally. I originally tried to make an appointment with Dr. McNally since she’s on the list but she had a very long wait list so I took a chance with someone else in the practice. Dr. Almeida was great! She asked a few questions to confirm my decision and went through the list of other options but she was quick to agree to the bisalp and even offered me options for additional pain management for my periods without trying to talk me out of my decision. I would definitely recommend her

**Plattsburgh**

Dr. Molly Mentzer DO, Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital UVM Health Network - 206 Cornelia Street Suite 202, Plattsburgh, NY12901 - Requested bilateral salpingectomy 9/9/20 received 9/28/20. 26yo childfree female. Stated her views but said as long as I knew that I was 100% sure that she would schedule me. Everyone at the GYN office and at the surgery was kind and respectful of my decision.

[Dr. Dianne Edgar](https://pwwh.com/providers/dr-edgar/). Bilateral Salpingectomy approved and performed by said doctor. Female, 27 when approved, 0 kids, unmarried (but long term relationship), no genetic conditions. Approved for procedure with very little resistance, but required 4 appointments (discussion, confirmation, pre-op, post op). Did not require meeting with SO. Cost nothing due to ACA + insurance, ~4K for doctor if uninsured. Mentioned "If you ever change your mind, you can always get IVF." Which I think is a plus. Due to COVID only does surgery some Tues and Fri.

They found an ovarian cyst that needed removal. Discussed once with Dr. Vial that I don't want children and want to get sterilized. Discussed that this is a permanent form of birth control, discussed risks/benefits, consent form was signed and I was scheduled for surgery. Took my request seriously the and was clear and concise with me. OP also advises that this doctor did a UNILATERAL salpingectomy as OP had previously had the other fallopian tube removed. 

[Dr. Linder](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/22438041-mitchell-a-linder) at 125 Lattimore Rd. in Rochester, New York. I am a childfree 32 year old woman, and Dr. Linder is my regular gynecologist. When I asked about the procedure, he didn't blink and said he could certainly do it, suggested the bilateral salpingectomy, and explained the procedure. He said he prefers to do that procedure because it's thought to really reduce risk for ovarian cancer. At my pre-op appointment, I had to sign a form from the hospital stating I knew risks etc. I was very happy with how I was treated by Dr. Linder. I never felt judged or second-guessed at any stage of the process. I've worked with him for 2 years now, and he is the best doctor I've ever had. I had the procedure done in conjunction with another, but I felt healed from this one in about 4-5 days.

Also: other locations in Rochester, Pittsford and Fairport. 2022. Elective hysterectomy on 37-year-old redditor. She was overwhelmingly kind to me when I thought I was facing a fight. She reassured me I was not. She initially told me "Yep, I'll do your hysterectomy for whatever reason, it's your body, it's your choice." Double points to her for being able to say that to me while she was pregnant. Clearly not a person who imposes her own morality on others. Dr. Repich set up my insurance paperwork so that the paperwork showed that it was Absolutely Medically F'ng Necessary that I get the  hysterectomy. This doctor is a good human!

**Schenectady**

[Nicholas Montalto](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/nicholas-montalto-206521#location). Performed a hysterectomy removing my uterus and fallopian tubes (and endometriosis), leaving my ovaries and by request leaving my cervix. Age 22, unmarried long term partnership, no plans for children bio/adopted/etc., Transmasculine legally male. He and his staff are very friendly, I did not encounter any bingos from anyone at his office. The nurses I worked with were very informed about the procedure and his methods. I felt listened to (they agreed I should keep my cervix if I felt it would make a difference to me) and they brought up the possibility of endometriosis before I did after listening to my symptoms. After reaching out to his office I was offered a surgery date 6weeks later and they were very flexible with my schedule (I had surgery 9weeks later instead). He did accept my insurance but I haven't received the bill yet to know how much it cost. Telemedicine is available for appointments that don't require physical examinations

She completed a bilateral salpingectomy on me. I am 32, single, and staunchly childfree. Dr. Lasky will sterilize anyone over 21 who knows they want to be child free for the remainder of their life. I experienced exactly zero pushback or bingos in asking for the bisalp, and she even, completely unprompted, offered me a hysterectomy due to extremely painful periods, endometriosis and adenomyosis. I waited about a week for my appointment (I was a patient at her office prior to seeing her about this so I don’t know how long wait times are for new patients).

He had me scheduled a month later and we were all done.

Dr. Stephen Brown - CNY Obstetrics & Gynecology, 5800 Heritage Landing Dr Ste C, East Syracuse, NY 13057. Preformed bilateral salpingectomy, covered through insurance, on 25 year old women with no children. Dr. Brown very much supports bodily autonomy. I had zero push back, and no unnecessary questions. I highly recommend him!

**Utica** 

[Dr. Lora Papandrea](https://www.obgyncny.com/our-team/) in Utica,NY to the list. She’s at OB/GYN Associates of Central NY. She can be very blunt and honest which I appreciate but never once did she question me about not wanting children. Medically she just makes sure everything is good to go and asked me when I wanted to schedule it. I was going to do it last year but had lost my job with COVID. We just did it on Monday May 2nd and everything went fine.

[Dr Amankwah in Utica](https://sdmg.com/provider/kwaku-a-amankwah-md/) - I got a bilateral salpingectomy from him less than a year ago. No referral, made an appt, got a surgery date at that appt, and was done in less than 3 months. Asked a few bingos but wasn't pushy, a bit condescending but wasn't rude, entire appt was 15 minutes. 

**Watertown** 

[Macy VanArnam, aka Dr. V in Watertown, NY](https://samaritanhealth.com/staff/macy-vanarnam-md/). Referred by Watertown Planned Parenthood and approved on first encounter after showing her sterilization binder. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy for me (22F, childfree, unmarried) on 12/9/22 with little issue. Will say she'd prefer you to get an IUD, but ultimately it's your body, your choice. States she's childfree herself. Post-op support pretty non-existent due to lack of communication from nursing line, but will schedule a 2-week post-op to ensure you're healing correctly.
