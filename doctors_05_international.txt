##ASIA

###South Korea

* [Dr. Peter Chung](http://houm.co.kr/eng/). I recieved a bisalp from him aged 26, unpartnered & no kids. Absolutely zero bingo-ing and incredibly supportive, after explaining my reasoning he agreed with no pushback. I speak Korean but he and most of the nurses speak English. Cannot recommend him enough

###Thailand

* Thais are very family oriented so especially young people trying to get vasectomies might experience resistance.

* [International Section, Paolo Memorial Hospital](http://paolohealthcare.com/eng/index.php/contract-us/international-section)
Good hospital near Saphan Khwai BTS station. I can't find the name of the doctor, but there is one who does vasectomies. I was 27 and lied that I have two kids back home. He "had to check hospital's opinion". I needed to wait 2 more days and then I was told it is okay and got snipped the same day. Price about 400$ (26h 41m) (2015).

* [Population and Community Development Association](http://www.pda.or.th/e_fp.asp) Near Asok BTS station. There is a [forum discussion](http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/224845-vasectomy-in-bangkok/) about the place. Almost free vasectomy. I was 27 when I went there and lied that I have 1y and 3y old kids. They told me to come back when I am at least 29 and the youngest kid should be at least 2 (these might change depending on the person working there, those where ~50y old women).

* [McCormick Hospital in Chiang Mai](https://mindofahitchhiker.com/my-60-day-stay-in-chiang-mai-thailand-i-just-dont-get-it/?fbclid=IwAR3TWyfGS90KGX622gWa10VNLOwJp5L2mfK-jUb1cpxN3h5pBfDn8Arwaig#Medical_Tourism)

###Singapore 

[Dr Beh](http://drbeh.com.sg/eng/). Laparoscopic sterilization with filshie clips. F 32 single and cf. Dr Beh had a brief chat to make sure I understood what I couldn't do after getting the procedure done. I know he was just covering his bases. He didn't challenge me about any of the usual bingos although he needed to say some of them for his sake. Immediately booked me for surgery on the first appointment.

+1 Dr. Beh. Sterilization with Filshie Clips on 29-year-old, married redditor. Dr Beh and the staff at Thompson Medical were professional, no one judged me for being CF. Wait times are minimal. Married patients to bring the spouse along during the consult as he does want to ensure both parties are on the same page. Patients using CPF: Medisave can be used to offset costs, however procedure isn’t covered under MediShield. Cost around $3250.

###India 

Dr. Deepak Rao Motherhood hospital, CMH road Bangalore Ph - +91 9880108844, performed hysterectomy for a childfree 35 year old woman. 

##EUROPE

###Austria

[Clinic in Vienna](http://www.prowoman.at/) that is willing to do tubals on woman 25+)

[Dr Thomas Treu](https://www.vasektomie.com/) 25+, ~, most experienced Dr for vasectomies in Vienna, and has fast appointments)

[Kepler Universitäts Klinikum](https://www.kepleruniklinikum.at/versorgung/kliniken/gynaekologie-geburtshilfe-und-gyn-endokrinologie/was-wir-tun/) Ambulance in Linz Upper Austria that does tubals on women 25+ (Cost as of 2016 is about )

[Woman & Health clinic in Vienna](https://www.womanandhealth.at/gynaekologie/verhuetung/sterilisation/), Dr. Johannes Seidel. Does bilateral salpingectomies. Asked me a few standard questions, but no bingos, no judgment, the whole thing was pretty uncomplicated and took less than 2 months from first consultation to the surgery itself. Cost as of 07/2020: 1200 EUR.

**Innsbruck**

[Dr Florian Zangerl](http://dieurologen.tirol/2016/01/01/zangerl/) 26m vasectomy, no kids. 

Dr. Ferdinand Walser Andreas-Hofer-Str. 4 6020 Innsbruck Telephone: 0512 5820 390. My boyfriend (childfree) got a vasectomy at the age of 29 after we were searching for a long time to find someone. Dr. Walser was very friendly, understanding, no bingoing and did a great job.

**Linz**

[dr.med. Karin haselsteiner](https://www.vonfrauzufrau.net/kontakt) 29yo childfree bilateral salpingectomy 

###Belgium

[Ruben Vanspauwen](https://www.azturnhout.be/artsen/dr-vanspauwen-ruben) in AZ Turnhout, Belgium. He is the head of the department and I must say that I am very happy with him. He listened to me in my first visit and never gaslighted me about my childfree attitude or minimized the medical reason I had to need a hysterectomy. He even suggested a salpingectomy on top to reduce chances of cancer. He made me wait three months until I got it aproved, which is stupid but not too inconvenient and it might be a hospital rule, I am not sure.

[Dr Hans Goethuys](http://www.zol.be/raadplegingen/urologie) Very experienced, no bingos.

**Brusells** 

[Dr. Jean Vandromme](https://www.stpierre-bru.be/prestataire/dr-jean-vandromme/) in Brussels. 21F (20 when starting the process), bilateral salpingectomy, single and childfree. 1st appointment with the doctor 2nd with social nurse to explain contraception options (very respectful and not infantilizing at all actually) 2 appointments with a psychologist from the hospital. Had to write a letter for the second meet-up. I actually kind of hated her. Got the results after the team had a meeting about my case. Doctor said they very rarely refuse (!!!). Got my tubes removed in September (process started in March). Even though the psychologist wasn’t amazing I would still recommend him and his team. They were caring and absolutely lovely when I got my surgery done.

**Ghent**

[Erik Merchiers] (http://www.azstlucas.be/zorgaanbod/artsen/detail/merchiers-erik). Very professional and friendly. Did my tubal ligation at 24 years old without giving me much trouble. Just checked if I was sure and informed about my decision. 

+1 Doctor Merchiers gave me a full hysterectomy at 27 years old (removal of uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes). I was required to get a psychological report before the operation (to make sure I was of sound mind).

+1 Tubal ligation on 22 year old woman.

+1 I got sterilised by Dr Merchiers (Belgium, Ghent) at 22(F). He was very kind and did not bingo me, only asked the necessary questions, always adding "I am legally obliged to ask/tell you this" so as not to come across as condescending. He required me to get a proof of competence letter (verklaring van wilsbekwaamheid) from my GP and then a few weeks later we could already plan the surgery. He performed a laparoscopy sterilisation tubaligature coagulation.

+1 Dr Eric Merchiers (Ghent, Belgium, hes already on the list) I got a bilateral salpingectomy done by him at age 18. He was very professional and gave me no bingos (he did suggest i look into getting an iud, but he didnt mention it again when i immediately dismissed the idea). I had to get a psychological evaluation done by a psychiatrist, which was a bit annoying, but it wasn't too hard to get. My first appointment with him was in end February, i had the surgery end September (however the reason it took so long for me was because i couldnt get it done in July, otherwise i wouldve gotten it end July). I was surprised with how professional he was about it and how accepting he was, because i expected a lot more difficulty getting sterilised at 18.

[Dr Antoine Raad](https://www.clstjean.be/team/raad-antoine) - Brussels, Hopital St Jean - Might not want to do it if you're "too young" but will do if you insist a bit and give a good argumentation or if you are late 30's.

[Dr. Carl van Haute](https://www.mchinfo.be/zorgaanbod/specialisten/van-haute-carl/) Performed a vasectomy on me (male, 24, in a relationship, fully childfree) Geconventioneerd. Professional, did not bingo me beyond what he is required to by medical rules.

[Dr. Dominique Carly](https://www.ghdc.be/prestataires/dr-carly-dominique) and [Fleurus and Gozée](https://santevitalite.be/). He asks for a letter from a psychiatrist (NOT a psychologist) and once you have that he asks no further questions - he is basically all business, doesn't care about age or reasons or anything else. No bingos.He does the operation at the Grand Hôpital de Charleroi, site Notre Dame.For his private practice, you can book an appointment online and there is usually one available within a week or two.This man is a godsend, one of the only doctors who performs bilateral salpingectomies in French-speaking Belgium. Anyway, hope this can help someone else.

###Bulgaria

[Dr. Gergana Kolarova and Dr. Georgi Kolarov](http://dockolarovi.com/) - Sofia, ul. Angel Kanchev 34 - Will give IUDs to young nulliparous women. A bit pricey but they are both very nice and highly qualified.

Dr. Milen Katzarov (Urologist and Andrologist) - Sandor Petofi street, number 39, site - drmilenkatzarov.com, phone number - +359 888 222 369, email - milen_k@hotmail.com,  Spoken languages - Bulgarian, German, French, Russian, English - Went in for a check up to see if I am viable for a vasectomy, 0 bingos from his side towards me, he just made sure I know what is going to happen and that the operation to fix it IF, at some point in time, I changed my mind, was 30% sucessful. Scheduled the operation for about 2 months after the inital check up, went in the hospital he operates in MBAL Doverie, got the snip, you can leave 2 hours later (if you feel unwell, you can stay for 2 days), local and full anesthesia is offered. 
Personal opinion - the doc is cool, made jokes as I was going into the operation and when I was coming out of the full anesthesia.

###Czechia

[Fakutlní Thomayerova nemocnice](http://www.ftn.cz/gynekologicko-porodnicke-oddeleni-43/) Do only bilateral salpigectomies.

[Městská nemocice Ostrava](http://www.mnof.cz/klinicka-oddeleni/urologie/ambulance/) does vasectomy for men. Standard 2x 14 days period as per Czech legislation applies; available to anyone above 18 years of age. Call them ahead as there is only one doctor (female) willing to do the procedure.

Jiří Chod Hospital: Canadian Medical, Prague 5 Cost of procedure: 40,000 CZK (covered by my insurance, but depends on insurance of course) Procedure is performed at the Prague 5 location, which is very modern with very kind nurses. All speak excellent English for those who need it. 

[Reprofit - Brno Pisárky] (https://www.reprofit.cz/)  Sterilize women from the age of 21. They speak 8 languages.

- 1 Reprofit, "I have just been in contact with the Czech clinic Reprofit in the hopes of getting sterilised and they told me they no longer perform sterilisations."

[Dr. Lucas Bittner](https://www.noscalpelvasectomy.cz/contact.html) at Centrum Mediol in Olomouc. Vasectomy for a 23/M. Legal for people 21 and older.

[MUDr. Šrámková at Fertimed, Czechia](https://www.noscalpelvasectomy.cz/contact.html). There are two clinics, one in Prague and one in Olomouc. The required consultation can be done over Skype and takes about 20 minutes. The wait times are a bit long, I waited about two months for the consultation and three months for the surgery. The surgery took 15 minutes and I was at the clinic for 40 minutes total. Staff was friendly and professional. The price of 13900 CZK includes a sperm count after three months, and you don't need to pay again if the surgery was not successful.

###Denmark

[Herlev Hospital](https://www.herlevhospital.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/Afdeling-for-Kvindesygdomme-Graviditet-og-Foedsler/kontakt/Sider/Kontakt-Kvindesygdomme-klinik-1.aspx) - the team I was sent to at Herlev Hospital were great. When surgery was decided, I asked if they could remove both tubes while they were in there, and the doc was like "if you ask nicely, I'm sure it can be arranged". Basically having a short chat to make sure I wasn't just panicking, but actually wanted it. And the performing surgeon also asked only once, the same way you'd ask any patient if they are still cool with what they are about to cut into. I also emphasized that I had no desire to preserve fertility, and asked if that affected the need for laparocopy. They explained that they had to do it that way whether I wanted kids or not.

[Lægerne Korsgade](http://www.korsgade24.dk/) Only ask if you already have children and accept it when you say you don't want them.

[Læge Anders Amundsen](https://www.45870326.dk/), Lyngby, Quickly accepted my (29M) intention of getting a vasectomy when I showed that I was determined and had deliberated on the subject previously. Adviced on  what to expect from the procedure from own experience and experience of other patients that had gone though it and gave the necessary refence to schedule an appointment with a clinic.

[Speciallæge i kirurgi og mavetarmkirurgi, ph.d, Anders Bak-Christensen](https://www.kir-al.dk/), Allerød, performed vasectomy after being referenced by own doctor, was quick, professional, informative and accepting.

We have a legal right to get sterilized, and the doctor performing the sterilization is not the same as the one you have the convo with and you don’t get to choose the actual surgeon. But it’s free, so that’s nice. I’m 32 woman, no kids, partnered, unmarried. General practictioner: [lægerne ilbjerg alle](http://www.bang-stougaard.dk), specifically Tine Stougaard Kristensen, she thinks getting sterilized is very invasive but didn’t fight me on it when I told her I was serious. 

Childfree friendly gynecologist: [kvindeklinikken i København](https://kvindeklinikkenkbh.dk), technically he didn’t have anything to do with the sterilization, but when I told him my doctor had suggested not getting sterilized he spent a bunch of time explaining the procedure and made me feel way safer about it. He makes you feel like you’re an equal and warned me that the hospital might give me some pushback and told me that hormonal iuds are the right choice for a lot of people, but not everybody and that should be respected. He recommended a salpingectomy to lower risk of cancer. I know he doesn’t necessarily qualify for this list, but finding a gynecologist that’s in your corner as a cf woman is *hard*, but no bingos, no nothing. He’s very much a gynecologist and not an ob and I wish I’d known about him earlier, no kids all over the waiting room either.

[Guldberg Kvindeklinik](https://www.guldbergkvindeklinik.dk/), Rikke Guldberg in Fredericia. Sent me straight to Kolding Hospital with a referal when I asked about it, no bingos. The hospital demanded a waiting period and an interview asking about relationsstatus and werent all that positive, but did the op. Some complications and 3 months untill no more pain. Tubal ligation 30+.

Evry: [Dr David Charbit](https://www.doctolib.fr/chirurgien-urologue/evry/david-charbit-evry) provided a vasectomy for a 27 year old man 

La Rochelle : [Dr Stéphane Milcent](https://www.mondocteur.fr/urologue/la-rochelle/stephane-milcent-16581.html) : https://twitter.com/SurLePonton/status/929032020889604096

Lille: hôpital Jeanne de Flandre, Dr Géraldine Giraudet and Dr Jessica Giordano sterilised me on Wednesday. I'm 36 and have no children. 

Lyon : [Dr Sergine HECKEL](https://www.ch-stjoseph-stluc-lyon.fr/medecin/21.HECKEL-Sergine/) : OB/GYN, tubal ligations for young childfree (18+)

Versailles/Le Chesnay : [Dr Pierre Panel](https://lemedecin.fr/le-chesnay/ch-de-versailles-site-andre-mignot/gynecologue-obstetricien/docteur-panel-pierre/953e0ed9ffe276550877978ec6bf6040/pro/) May 2023. Tubal ligation on 21-year-old redditor. He was incredibly respectful, as was his medical secretary (she's an absolute angel) and as were the rest of his staff. No bingo, no distasteful questions, no patronization, just patience, listening skills and empathy, and explaining in simple terms without being condescending. I was asked my reasons to make sure i wasn't forced of anything, but i just said i didn't want children and that was it. You may have to get a note from a psychiatrist, but he doesn't require this. Dr. Panel practices in the private sector on Thursdays and in the public sector the rest of the week. I chose the private sector because I specifically wanted him to operate. Sécurité Sociale covers 80% of the cost if you have the surgery done on the public sector. The rest is almost always covered by your insurance but if it isn't you can have ~50 euros to pay. Appointments are covered (no payment in advance, there is the "tiers-payant" where the social security covers the amount in advance). For private sector care, appointments are 100 euros, reimbursed at 70% of the base public price for a specialist (so 70% of ~50-60 euros) and the rest is usually covered by most insurances. The procedure in itself is also covered 80%, mine had complications (he treated me for endometriotic lesions), so, of the 1330 euros that were due, i only had 260 euros left to pay, which is covered by most insurances, so in the end i did not pay anything at all. 


Roquebrune Cap Martin (next to Monaco, approx 30 mins by car from Nice) : [Dr Cristina Longo](https://www.doctolib.fr/gynecologue/menton/cristina-longo-menton)

Marcq-en-Barœul : [Dr Phillippe Koenig](https://www.doctolib.fr/chirurgien-urologue/marcq-en-baroeul/philippe-koenig), vasectomy. 

###Georgia 

**Tbilisi** 

[Madona Jugheli](https://carapsmedline.ge/en/). I recently got approved for bisalp and my doctor was SO professional and didn't question me once, didn't bingo or anything. I'm 22 she approved me and even directed me to a childfree friendly surgeon! Caraps Medline has a medical tourism option. 

### Germany

Here (https://www.selbstbestimmt-steril.de/karte/) is a map with German doctors who perform sterilisations on women. The doctors are on that list voluntarily and have minimum age and/or number of children requirements added. 

-  Worms, https://urologie-worms.de/. The doc was a little overwhelmed with my age and cf status, but never made any negative remarks and was all around very pleasant. The complete cost of 450€ i had to pay cash in full.

- [Urologische Praxis im Zentrum in Wiesbaden](http://www.vasektomie-wiesbaden.de/). When in doubt, ask for Dr. Spielhaupter, who appears to be very relaxed about doing the procedure on someone who seems confident enough in his decision.

+1 for Dr. Spielhaupter, he didn't have any problems with my age. But he only does vasectomies with general anesthesia, and it costs about 780€. Other than that I can wholeheartedly recommend getting your vasectomy here.

- [Dr. Söffker, Praxisklinik Goldenes Horn](http://www.vasektomie-soeffker.info). Dr. Söffker did the vasectomy on me (29, male) without asking more than 2 questions and having me sign a waiver form. Since I live abroad and only come to Germany once in a while, I didn't even have a prior consultation, everything was done via email. The Doc himself has lived quite a while outside of Germany and is fluent in English if anyone feels like travelling in for the procedure.

+1 Dr. Söffker has also sterilised a 23 M unmarried, "It was almost painless." 

+1 Dr. Söffker sterilized 30M from Sweden, appointment via email, no questions asked

+1 Dr. Söffker sterilized unmarried 22M from Italy, appointment made already at 21 years old, no questions asked

+1 Dr. Soffker.  Vasectomy on 22-year-old redditor. Perfectly acceptable bedside manner and great English fluency, was perfectly fine with my request to see any removed bits, did try to rush us out the door once done though.

- [Dr. Birgit Ruhmland](http://praxis-ruhmland.de/) in Berlin-Hellersdorf scheduled surgery for 28 y.o. female and offered to find second doctor for referral (rule / regulation for under 30 y.o. women in Germany)

- [Dr. Andreas Putz](https://dbknb.de/gyn), Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Klinikum in Neubrandenburg.  He does hysterectomies on young childless women with an psychological assessment (psych. Gutachten). I am 24 and get my uterus removed due to adenomyosis and endometriosis.

- [Praxis Dr. Bung, Dr. Richter, Fr. Prochnau in Bonn](http://www.gyn-praxisklinik-bonn.de/). Referred to from ProFamilia Bonn from good experiences with previous sterilizations. Got a tubal ligation in early 30s. Dr. Bung was not happy, but the only judgement came in a form to sign. Brought my hubby and dressed like middle management, assuming that shut him up. 

- [Dr. Andreas Roth, Munich](http://www.gyn-op.de/start/content_start.html): Got a tubal ligation at the age of 22. I wasn't asked ask a lot of questions, however I did have a referral from my gynecologist and a history of problems with other forms of birth control. 

 -1 Dr Roth, gave a 24AFAB a lot of bingoes when requested to provide a hysterectomy. OP ultimately did not feel comfortable trying to move forward with this specialist. 

- [Dr. med. Mehmet Bastug](https://www.gyn-op.de/), tubal ligation 25yo. Dr. Bastug already operated on me last year. During a post-op checkup I asked him if he would perform a sterilisation (apparently tubal ligation is the golden standard in Germany). No bingos at all. Endometriosis resection was also part of the surgery. I got the endometriosis diagnosis within a few month of being a patient of his while my (former) OB-GYN never even mentioned it in over 8 years. So thats also a big plus. I felt comfortable and was very well taken care of by the whole team - before and after the surgery.

- Gynäkologische Praxisklinik Hamburg (https://gph-online.de/), Dr. Gerd Kügler did my sterilization when i was 30. He cuts each tube 3x + cauterizing the ends. Costs: ~700€. Told him my motivation, he asked me one time if i was really sure, i answered that i am sure for 10 years and that's it.

- [Praxis Radler - Keller in Mannheim] (https://www.radler-keller.de/home.html): Got a vasectomy at the age of 27, it was done by Dr. Joachim Häfele. He asked some questions, then said my answers made him feel that I understand what I was doing and that it was my decision. He explained the procedure and answered all questions very well. Rest of the team was also very professional. Cost ~600€

- [Dr. A. Maucher - OPZ Hürth] (https://www.mvz-opz.de): Sterilizes (childfree) woman from the age of 25.

+1 for OPZ. Incredibly no-fuss about the whole thing. Not a single bingo From anyone on the staff. Procedure was not done by Dr. Maucher himself but a young female colleague of his.

+1 for OPZ. Provided bilateral salpingectomy for a 27yo. Dr Kemper did initial consult, with Dr. Schwirz-Groos performing the surgery. "She and the rest of the team were also very supportive and professional". 

- [Weimar sophien und hufeland Klinik] (http://www.klinikum-weimar.de/web/de/content/content.php?areaID=5) from the age of 23 but only with a psychology control (Psychologisches Gutachten)

- [Dr. Möckel - Leipzig] (http://dr-moeckel.com/) Didn't really asked for my motivation. I was 28 and childfree.

- [Dr. med. Lars Norrenberg (Oberarzt) - Frauenklinik Reutlingen] (https://www.kreiskliniken-reutlingen.de/frauenklinik/team.html) I was 28 y/o at this time, childfree and asked for a sterilization. He didn't asked me why. No bingos. He is very easy going. The  procedure costs 500€. 

- [Dr. Heß - Bochum] (http://medi-plaza-bochum.de/) Head of the MediPlaza medical center. Amazingly open-minded about various degrees of childfreeness. Can perform most forms of IUDs. Can‘t perform a sterilization herself but will refer you to a colleague in Dortmund who will make exceptions based on Dr. Heß‘ referral.

- [Urologie Frechen/Hürth](https://www.urologie-frechen.de/) I got a vasectomy from Dr. Lipphardt when I was 27. While he seemed a bit hesistant at first (asked a few questions), he did it when seeing I was committed to it.

- [Park-Klinik Kiel](https://www.park-klinik-kiel.de/) CF got a salpingectomy at the age of 30. Was asked a few fair questions, to check if the decision was really well thought through. Cost 500€.

-  [Dr. med. Ali Barhoum](https://www.urologie-barhoum-mannheim.de/). Vasectomy. I am 27 years old, married, without kids. The doctor gave me stern talking to and advised against it, since I am not 30 yet and have no kids. When I demonstrated that I was sure, he had me sign a waiver. The procedure costed 550€, he offered me a date in the following week.

- [Dr. Bernd Friedel](https://www.arzt-auskunft.de/arzt/frauenheilkunde-und-geburtshilfe/dortmund/dr-bernd-friedel-3616343), Wittekindstr. 105, 44139 Dortmund: Bisalp on 23 y.o. woman, very professional, no bingos.

+1 to Dr. Bernd Friedel in Dortmund Germany. Very professional, no bingos, no age restriction. Costs are: 430€ for a salpingectomy, 274€ if you have your Doctors note for removal of a cyst. 2 appointments needed, one for talking and then the operation (took me exactly 7 days) he will call you the evening after the operation to ask if you’re feeling alright and resting well.

- [Dr. Daniel Karohl](https://www.frauenarzt-karohl.com/) Schönhauser Allee 118 10437 Berlin GERMANY. I had a tubal ligation under general anaesthetics.

- [Contact points for sterilisation - Selbstbestimmt steril](https://www.selbstbestimmt-steril.de/karte/) Officially contacted contact points for sterilization requests. Map online since 31.08.2020 and will be updated regularly.

[Arthur Karsten in 54439 Saarburg](https://www.frauenarzt-karsten.de) - I'm 22 and have no kids, but he took me serious immediately, offered me an appointment within two weeks and was overall a pleasure to work with. The procedure (tubal ligation) was performed under full anesthesia, I was in the hospital from 7am to 11:40am. It cost 600€, wasn't covered by insurance

+1 Dr. Karsten While he didn't sterilize me, he gave me the crucial referral (Überweisung) for my hysterectomy for another clinic, which refuses to operate on me without it. He never questioned me about why I didn't want kids and was only focused on helping me.

[Dr. Katharina Schwarzkopf](https://doceins.de/aerzte/katharina-schwarzkopf/) Gynecologist - required to refer to surgeon. Borna, Saxony, Germany. Absolutely positive experience throughout the last 4 years I've been a patient at her office. My childfree status was accepted right from the start, absolutely no bingos. She takes all the time needed to help you and objectively suggests treatment options from all fields. She is also fairly knowledgeable regarding endometriosis and adenomyosis, but isn't doing excision surgery anymore herself. Also: Surgeon - Dr. Francis Nauck, Gesundheitszentrum Bitterfeld-Wolfen, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany Procedure: Hysterectomy Dr. Nauck is certified as a MIC III specialist (certification for minimal invasive surgery) and highly knowledgeable in treating endometriosis, fibroids and other uterus-related conditions. He is very childfree-friendly and I experienced absolutely no pushback requesting my hysterectomy during our 5 min phone consultation. The examination pre-surgery was extremely insightful, he took a lot of time answering all potential questions and to suggest the best surgery approach while still leaving the final decision to me. I also received in-depth aftercare after my surgery to make sure I'm leaving completely fine. Compared to a previous surgery the year before (endo excision and bisalp) my recovery was also way faster, although this second surgery was more invasive. According to fellow patients I met at the hospital and numerous online reviews Dr. Nauck performed a lot of bisalp and hysterectomy surgeries on other childfree people in the past, who had a similarly pleasant experience.

[Dr. med. Dipl. Kfm. Arne Behm Prasix Mainurologe](https://www.mainurologe.de/) "Very professional and friendly. No bingos at all, just made sure I was sure about this and that's that. Carefuly explained the procedure to me. Had to wait a month for the preminilary talk appointment and then another month for the procedure. Procedure itself was quick and painless. 10/10"  I'm 33, no kids, not married, CF all my life.

[Dr. Reimar Domnitz](https://www.urologe-friedrichshain.de/index.php), "Facharztpraxis für Urologie im Ärztehaus Friedrichshain", Landsberger Allee 44, 4.OG 10249 Berlin. I had two appointments with Dr. Domnitz. The first time I went there, I got bingoed by some nurses at the entrance and had to talk my way through to Dr. Domnitz, because they told me they would decline my request for a vesectomy. Dr. Domnitz sat down with me, heard what I said and told me to think about it and come back in 6 months. I called back 6 months later, got scheduled and had the procedure done without any more questions or complications.

[Janusz Rudzinski,Prenzlau, Germany](http://jrudzinski.com/) he performed sterilisation on three of my CF friends, He's renowned for performing abortions on Polish women who cannot do it at home due to draconian laws on it, and is famous advocate on women's rights to self determination and deciding their fate. Though I have to warn he's also very talkative. :) He works with a couple of clinics and also has extensive contacts in the industry, so if he cannot take a patient, he will refer to someone who will be able to perform sterilisation at a similar cost.

Dr. Rüdiger Söder from Mic.Ma Mainz, a women's clinic in Mainz, Germany. Dr. Söder was extremely respectful and friendly. He asked me once in referral and once before surgery "are you sure you don't want kids?" I said yes and he replied, "good then we may proceed." No judgment, no extra hoops.

Gyndoctors: http://www.gyndoctors.de/ Dr. Teichmann and Dr. Schröder Buchen for the talk and pre-op stuff one day before the surgery, Hospital in Hardheim for the actual procedure. Done in a few hours, you can go home same-day. They offer ligations with cauterizing, bisalps and ablations. What I had done: Bisalp + Endometrial Ablation. I'm 23F, no bingos, very respectful. Cost was 1600€, very clean incisions and great belly button reconstruction after laparoscopy. Endometrial ablation done via rollerball method. I waited 6 months because I was saving money, otherwise about ~2 months time to get a surgery date.

### Greece 

[Dr Tryfos Dimitrios](https://www.xo.gr/profile/profile-905836669/en/) - performed a tubal ligation on me when I was 21, unmarried and childfree. He gave me no hassle, just asked me if I was really sure I wanted it and my surgery was booked the next day. It cost about 3600 euros out of pocket.

### Iceland 

- [Dr Rafn Hilmarsson](https://ja.is/laeknastodin-glaesibae/ArNAk/), læknir Læknastöðin ehf Address: Álfheimum 74, 104 Reykjavík, +354 535 6800. Vasectomy for 31 year old childfree single male. State insurance covers nearly all costs (if the patient has been in the country for at least 6 months). Out of pocket costs < $30. Got appointment for within 2 weeks. No questions asked, just the age etc. information, and confirmation that I understood what it meant to be sterilized. No other questions.

### Ireland

- [Padua GP Clinic, Cork City] (No website available) Dr Shane Murphy believes that people should be able to choose whether or not to have children. Is willing to make a referral. Will advise based on age that you may be considered too young, but this is to prepare you for what consultants will say. Asked questions many would find bingoish (relationship status being one) but the information was for the referral letter for a gynaecologist to help build a case for me.

- [Cork Medical Centre - Dr S McLaughlin](http://www.corkcitymedicalcentre.com/) in Cork, Ireland. I am 30F, unmarried, no kids. I first went to them for an IUD but it gave me such horrible side effects that I asked for it out only six months later. The doctor told me that they like to see, in Ireland, that you've tried different contraceptive methods first before requesting sterilization (IUD, implant, BC pills, all of which I'd used in the past). But ultimately, she said that if I wanted sterilization then that's what I wanted, and she wrote me a referral to the CUMH Gynaecology Dept on the spot. It's been about two months, and I just got an appointment for a consultation in the mail. Originally she had referred me for a tubal ligation, but I called back asking about a bilateral salpingectomy and she said it's the same referral form so when I go to my consultation I'll just ask for that procedure instead of the tubal ligation and it should all be fine.

- Dr John McCormack (http://vasectomyireland.ie/) did my vasectomy at age 23 and didnt put up much fight to persuade me otherwise. He asked me the usual questions on relationships, why I wanted it done (didnt offer any rebutals just listened) and was I aware that its permanent , 50% chance of reversal etc.
Since I had not caused a pregnancy before sent me to get a fertility test done. This was simply to verify if I even needed one before going ahead with the procedure and avoid the risk of any possible complications. It cost me 500 in total, was no needle no scalpel and almost completely pain free for the procedure and afterwards. He operates in Cork City, Galway City and Dublin City on weekly rotations so covers the whole country.

- Dr Ravi Kumar - Clonard Surgery, Wexford town, Ireland No: (053) 914 2459. Method: Scalpel incision. Personal info: 36, single and no kids. Dr Ravi is practicing his profession for over 35 yrs and to my knowledge the only doctor who can provide this service in my home town. On the initial consultation he asked very thorough questions ensuring I was in the correct frame of mind without being invasive. He was extremely open minded to my decision to have this procedure and made me feel very at ease. The surgery went very well and he made me feel very comfortable all the way throughout. The procedure cost €450 but thankfully my insurance will cover 80% of this. I had to wait 4 weeks for the surgery as there was a backlog and he only performs this surgery twice a week on Fridays so I’d suggest taking this day off and resting the whole weekend

###Italy

[Doctor Marco Torrazzina](http://www.marcotorrazzina.it/Home.html) Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me, a 27 year old international student. Initial consultation is 150 euros but if you have a tessera sanitaria (Italian health service card) the surgery and post-surgery medicine will be free. The sterilization even offered an overnight stay. Learn some Italian as while he can speak English, some of the staff do not.

+1 dott. Marco Torrazzina, he's definitely the one to go to if you're in Italy. I just got my bilateral salpingectomy and I'd like to add my experience to the list because it was overwhelmingly positive, I got treated with the outmost respect and kindness by the whole stuff without being bingoed not even once even tho I'm just 24yo. They were very considerate about my phobia of needles and did whatever they could to ease my discomfort. The whole procedure didn't cost me a dime except for €150 for the first consultation with my doctor.

[AIED](http://www.aied.it/) The Pordenone office is the only one to perform vasectomies.

[Dr. Pasquale Scarano at the Nuova Ricerca in Rimini](http://www.nuovaricerca.com/) accepted to perform a vasectomy on my husband after a visit. He needed a little of persuasion and justified the operation as if my husband had chronic pain (vasectomies aren't illegal in Italy but doctors are more paranoid than American ones). To be noted that he usually treats infertility problems.

Milan: [Dr. Marco Cosentino](http://www.marcocosentino.com/en/vasectomy/) He was very professional and had no problems with my age (27) or the fact I didn't have any kids. I had a bilateral no scalpel vasectomy the same day as the consultency. He is based in Padova, but can travel to various Italian cites. This was done privetly, so was very expensive in comparison to being done publicly (€1800), but it was a very easy experience. He speaks perfect English and most of the staff in the Milan also spoke English.

-1 Dr Cosentino quoted a patient €2200 when in the Italian website clearly says he's willing to do the procedure for €800, up to maximum €1500 based on the kind of anesthesia).

The following doctors are unverified, but may perform bilateral salpingectomy: 

Milan: Massimo Luerti, massimo.luerti@ic-cittastudi.it, Nr appointment +39 0223932041. He asked me for a counseling or a possible letter from a psychologist/psychiatric visit because of my age. 

Milan: Paolo Vercellini, "Hospital Policlinico of Milan", paolo.vercellini@policlinico.mi.it, Nr for appointment +39 800.638638. May ask for a psychiatrist/psychologist visit. 

Verona Valentino Bergamini City Verona "Via Ca' di Cozzi, 10, 37124 Verona VR" valentino.bergamini@aovr.veneto.it nr +39 045 916433 asks for a psychiatric visit before his appointment experience : After reading my letter it was instant approval. He was accommodating of my sexual trauma and gyn exam phobia, didn't push me for internal exams, and allowed me to have an external ultrasound. He was warm like a grandpa and very understanding. I paid private to see him because getting an appointment through the health system would have taken months. He was also kind enough to speed the surgery date, was able to get it after 3-4 months of wait. I was also allowed to not wake up with a catheter (phobia), and per request they gave me the video of the surgery on the USB I brought with me. The hospital is known for one of the best in Italy, and it showed. Not one person judged me or my age, everyone was kind and warm. I still remember the kind nurses and anesthesiologist who held my cheeks as I was going under.

Additional note from OP:  in Italy we gained the right to sterilisation together with the right to abortion. It is covered by the Italian healthcare system SSN, you only need to be over 18 and able to consent for yourself. If any hospital they give an number of age or kids to be allowed the surgery, know its only the rules the doctors of the hospital made and its not law. 

Pontedera Near Pisa Via Roma: Massimo Srebot Retired but still answers his mail, n. 147 - 56025 Pontedera, srebot2406@gmail.com. Gave me the number +39 0587273234 and said someone named Barbara takes appointments. He confirmed the hospital does bilateral salpingectomy

Rome: Stefano Vitali,  San Camillo Forlanini Hospital, dottstefanovitali@gmail.com, Nr +39 392 086 3344, From past reviews online and my own experience, he is very slow at responding,my friend met him and he is very warm and welcoming. Found him in a live stream where he was advocating for women rights to abortion and sterilisation.

Pisa Roberta Tana Tel: 0587 273330 (Mon-Fri 12:00-13:30) The person on the call was kind and assured me many times that they do not discriminate based on age or kids, and the choice is fully of the personal and respected. Met with Roberta Tana, was the most professional person met so far. They asked me the reason why I want the surgery, asked me if I want the exams, did not push for them and allowed me not to get a transvaginal ultrasound. I only did the external. She made me sign the preo operation papers, and the waiting is a short 2 months ! After surgery : Amazing experience, most of the surgery staff were women!

###Latvia 

From another forum: I emailed (info@myclinicriga.lv) [My Clinic Riga](https://myclinicriga.lv/) to know if they offer either hysterectomy or bisalp. To my surprise, they do offer hysterectomy without the need for a medical emergency. I can request it and they will do it. The costs are a bit high though. Your consultation will be online (WhatsApp) for 80 euros. The doctor speaks both English and Russian. The surgery itself will cost from 2000 to 3000 laparoscopic. It will depend after the consultation. Stay in the hospital will be 150 Euros per night. NB this member has not achieved sterilisation from this hospital yet. 

###Luxembourg

[Dr Victor-Emmanuel JOURET +352 49 12 17](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fj6gteEXCdxcdsLu9). Vasectomy, 29yo. I haven't received the bills from the hospital for the anesthesia and a few other things yet but the doctor's fee was 500€, not covered by the Luxembourgish social security. No bingos but was insistant on making sure I knew it was non reversible and that it was my choice (aka not being pushed by my girlfriend).

###Malta

See this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/9f8a0n/psa_vasectomy_rocks_3/ 

The doctor is not on the list, I live in Malta. Not sure how that list works, but it was this clinic: http://www.stannesclinic.com/

Should a Maltese person happen to read this, I can only give the highest recommendation to the clinic. Very efficient and friendly service.

I only had one consultation before the operation, and it was rather quick. I expected more intrusive questions, especially as Malta is very into Catholicism, but my worries were unfounded.

The doctor went over the procedure, and explained the unlikely bad scenarios (swelling, pain), and also reiterated a lot of stuff I already knew, having read about the procedure online (it is safe, it has no effect on sexual performance etc). Then he did a quick check and I was out in 10-15 minutes.

### The Netherlands 

- [Dr. Yenny Kurniawan](https://www.martiniziekenhuis.nl/zorg/behandelaars/y-s-yenny-kurniawan/) Martini Hospital Groningen, Telefoonnummer: (050) 524 5245. March2023. Bisalp on 27-year-old redditor. She only required me to talk to an external person once to confirm this is what I wanted and proceeded to plan the surgery immediately. This doctor is a female ob-gyn, childfree by choice as well. I felt very understood and taken seriously.

- [Dr Nader Naderi](https://www.sterilisatieklinieken.nl/en/) at Den Haag. They never asked if I had kids, just if I was satisfied with how many I had. If you are over 30 years old it is super straightforward, under 30 has a few more hoops to jump through but they have all the info on their site. 

- [Dr H. van Dongen](https://www.ghz.nl/uw-zorgspecialist/h-van-dongen/) and [Dr. R.G.W. Nijman](https://www.ghz.nl/uw-zorgspecialist/r-g-w-nijman/) at the Groene Hart Ziekenhuis in Gouda performed removal of Fallopian tubes via laparoscopy for 30F.

- Dr. Weinans, Gelderse Vallei Vivre in Ede. This doctor is a bit sceptical at first and will ask you all the questions and probably send you through to a psychological evaluation to make sure you are certain in your decision. He didn't refuse the procedure after I explained what I wanted and why. After some convincing he was very friendly.

- [Bergman Clinics](http://www.bergmanclinics.nl/) in de Bilt and in Amsterdam. Will in principal do Essure sterilization on women age 30 and over. During the first meeting the doctor asked me "You know you can't have children when I perform this procedure on you, right?". When I confirmed that yes, I understood that, I got the OK. 

- Dr. Andreas Thurkow at the [Academisch Medisch Centrum] (https://www.amc.nl/web/Zorg.htm). NB no longer sterilising young, unmarried women.  

- Dr. Klapwijk, located at the [Vivre clinic in Hospital De Gelderse Vallei](http://www.geldersevalleivivre.nl/Gynaecologie.html), Ede. NB Dr Klapwijk has retired.

- Dr. Westerling, located at [Medisch Centrum Tollius](https://tollius.praktijkinfo.nl/), Amersfoort. She was the one that gave me my referal at age 30. The "worst" bingo I got was a "We don't normally approve someone so young without kids" but beyond that I got all the information about the procedure. Managed to impress her about my knowledge and even being able to recite failure rates. And she provided two possible locations, in-house and the local hospital, so I could choose where I would want to have it. She told me that if their in-house wouldn't approve me I would get her written approval to go to the hospital. I chose to have mine performed by their in-house doctor, Dr. Kars (see below). She also told me that if there was doubt about your conviction they even provide "psychological screening" in-house to determine your mental state and maybe get you approved that way.

- Dr. Kars, located at [Medisch Centrum Tollius](https://tollius.praktijkinfo.nl/), Amersfoort. Specialises in male sterilisation. Has a "phone intake" before he approves patients. During the phone intake he did the usual questionare they are required to do and approved of my decision without any hassle. Also gave me the full list of information about how he does the procedure. When I got to my appointment I got a short recap of all the information just before the procedure and simply got told to remove my pants and lie down. Very friendly, funny and supportive man.

- Dr. Oosterbaan, located at [Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis](https://www.jeroenboschziekenhuis.nl//smartsite.shtml?ch=INT&amp;amp;amp;id=103066/), Den Bosch. I explained to him that I had no desire to have kids. We went through all the standard questions and he informed me that my case would have to be brought up to a council due me being under 30 (I'm 28). He would defend me and it looks like he won. This hospital works on a referral base though.

- Dr. Vork, located at [Alrijne ziekenhuis](https://www.alrijne.nl/locaties/leiden/), Leiden. He had no problems sterilizing me at 26. He did have to discuss it with the other gynecologists because I was under the age of 30. Just a head's up: they did ask my to do a psychological evaluation with a psychologist in the hospital to make sure you don't do it because of coercion or psychological issues. I did tell them (after I passed the evaluation) it was condescending, the psychologist understood and was very understanding during the hour we talked.  

- Dr Brunekreef at huisartspraktijk Kiewiet,Zwolle. She referred me to a urologist at the Isala clinic (which I hear can be quite hard, especially here in the Dutch Bible belt). I don't remember which urologist I got (I'll try akig them later, but I don't think you get to choose the doctor anyway). It took a bit of smooth talking about why I didn't want kids (I exaggerated my family's already serious history of hereditary diseases), and he agreed. I think he was more afraid about me changing my mind later. I assured him that I won't come back to cry about it. He laughed and gave me the ok. Procedure was done in 20 minutes or so. My balls hurt for a few days, and that was it. 

- [Dr. Bas Veersema Location: UMC \(Utrecht\)](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl/ziekenhuis/zorgverleners/veersema-s) Procedure: Bilateral salpingectomy Me: 26 years old, not married and childfree. A friend of mine had recommended this doctor, I got a referral through my GP and dr. Veersema stated: most gyno's would say you're too young. I don't think that way. He just wanted to hear why I wanted it (I wrote down my arguments beforehand) and agreed to do the procedure within minutes. He even helped me with my insurance.

-1 UMC Utrecht: This location no longer does any steralisations on people under 35. The whole hospital updated their policy on this jan 2023. No doctor in that hospital is allowed to perform any surgeries regarding steralisation unless health is at risk. This goes for: tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy and vasectomy.

- [J. van de Ven. and A.P. Gijsens in het Elkerliek Ziekenhuis](https://www.elkerliek.nl/elkerliek/wie-is-mijn-dokter-(v)/ven,-de-heer-dr-j-van-de.html) in Helmond. Sterilisation for 21F. OP writes: I will say that my own doctor gave him a message that explained really well why I wanted to get sterilized wich was his reason to approve me since he mostly just gets message saying "Sterilization" without an explanation. So I would recommend to mention that you will need to give a bit more detail than just "I want it". 

- Dr. Oncko van Vierssen Trip and the whole team at Andros clinic (we visited their branch in Baarn), https://www.andros.nl/. For 23 male, they followed basic legal procedure for under 30: you need a GP referral, 1st visit they ask you if you're sure and they explain the procedure and recovery. No bingos. After that they schedule the actual vasectomy in about a month or two depending on how busy they are (and then the count check after 3 months). They were also great at following up and answering questions about recovery.

- Dr. Marielle Bergmeijer, from Huisartesen Zuid Amersfoort, https://huisartsenamersfoortzuid.nl/, referral without questions or bingoes.  Her only question was "are you sure?", and she did note that we need a private clinic as hospitals don't approve vasectomies under 30.

###Norway

Public option in Norway is very limited but private sector can cover you.

- Morten Andersen, C-Medical Moelv. Vasectomy, 26 Y/O, single, with no kids. 10-12 day wait time. Only question that was asked was basically just "Are you sure", and when I said "yes", that was enough. "Drop you clothes down under and get on the table". They also asked about relationship status and kids during the procedure, I answered honestly "single, no kids" and he said it was my choice, and mine alone. When I asked him, he said he usually does at least 1 vasectomy a week. And that one year he'd done about 450. Price: from 5750 NOK, minimum age for a vasectomy is 25 years old.
 
- [Sevat Løkensgard Molven](https://www.aleris.no/leger/sevat-lokensgard-molven/) Clinic was professional and friendly, still you need to fill in forms and be over 25. He did ask if i was sure but procedure table as just one meter away. They do not offer sperm count test after the vasectomy.[You can book online](https://www.aleris.no/en/make-an-appointment/)

### Poland

Dr Dariusz Dobrowolski He sees patients in Lodz, Poland at two locations: the Kopernika Hospital and the Pulsmed Hospital. I made an appointment at Pulsmed by calling the number listed on https://pulsmed.com.pl/ The procedure costs 2000 PLN + initial consultation 200 PLN + cost of Covid test before surgery 100 PLN + medications and dressings ~150 PLN. During the initial consultation there are NO questions about the reasons for the vasectomy, the doctor did not ask if I have children. He immediately explained the procedure and its consequences in a matter-of-fact manner. The procedure scheduled for a month later went very smoothly (3 hours in the hospital, 30 minutes of the procedure itself). After the procedure, he gave a private phone number to contact with any questions or concerns.

### Portugal 

Lisboa - there is [Clínica dos Arcos](http://clinicadosarcos.com/) - Clínica Dos Arcos Rua da Mãe de Água 15A 1250-154 Lisboa, they tie your tubes and do vasectomies. Downside: the clinic is private and insurances do not cover sterilisation so you have to pay out of pocket. Count around 1800€ for the thing and if you dont live in Lisboa add lodging to that. If you dont have money you can always try via Servico Nacional de Saúde (SNS) where it would be completely free, but it is very, very hard to find a doctor willing to do it. Reminder that in Portugal the legal minimum age for sterilisation is 25 years.

-1 Dra Bruna Abreu of Clinica dos Arcos. Refused sterilization for 32-year-old CF redditor because "I'm too young, I might meet someone someday, bla bla bla..." She did offer the implant or IUD. This was a waste of 85€.

###Romania

[Dr. Dorin Grigoraș] Centrul Medical Dr. Grigoras. Profesor universitar. Medic Şef Secţie Clinica II Obstetrică Ginecologie Sp.Cl. Municipal de Urg.Timişoara.
Adress: Str. Calea Sagului Nr. 20
Telephone:0356 912
Had a friend ask for a favor with this doctor to do a tubal ligation, while I was 24 y.o. in 2011. He programmed me 4 days after the initial discussion. We had a long discussion about other contraceptive methods, bingos and such. I payed 350 euro and it was mentioned in my file that I had an ovarian cyst removed. We went through the insurance system on emergency protocol (cyst), but he also had available his own medical centre (more costly though). Surgery was done with laparoscopy as he is the best at it in the whole west part of the country. If you ever want to go to him for a tubal ligation, mention that there was a girl 9-10 years ago who he handled and she is happy with decision still and is married to a childfree sterile man - one of the bingoes was - "what if the love of your life wants children?"
The line that sealed the deal was "I am getting this procedure done and some doctor will perform it on me, but I would rather have the best doctor do it, rather than a mediocre one." He helped me reach my goal and I hope he will help you too.

### Spain

Dr.Francisco de Borja Caballero Borredá. He has his office at the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda. You'll need to be registered at the Madrid's public health care system and Seguridad Social. First you will need to register at one of the two Centro de Atención Primaria de Majadahonda and choose hospital of reference to be Hospital Puerta de Hierro. In Madrid, you can freely choose your doctor and [health care center](https://www.comunidad.madrid/servicios/salud/libre-eleccion-sanitaria.)

Then you need to ask for a consult with a Medico de familia, I recomend you Gimeno Santamaria, Maria Luz, she's a really nice woman. And them ask her/him to refer you to ginecologia and specific the name of the doctor. Ask him for "more permanent birth control". 

Ramin Hajianfar, CLÍNICA GINECOLÒGICA SANTS - Carrer de Roger, 23, 08028 Barcelona, Spain. I'm 27 and he said "he doesn't mind doing the surgery for young people". However, all patients under 30 must go through a psychological exam. The first visit costs 50 euro and the exam costs another 50. This is subtracted from the surgery cost though, so you always pay 400 for the procedure. Additionally, you need to take a rapid COVID test when coming for surgery, this costs extra 70 (test with blood sample). The psychological exam and COVID test can be done elsewhere if you prefer but they offer them both in the same clinic. Most staff speaks English pretty well, only the psychiatrist didn't but one of the nurses translated for me. I have no genetic disease or anything like that, they were happy when I just told them I read about this a lot and considered all the options, and would rather adopt than have children of my own.

-1 CLÍNICA GINECOLÒGICA SANTS, another member phoned the clinic and was told they don't do tubal ligations.

[Dr. med. Evgenia Bousouni. Practices at KSA, Aarau, Switzerland](https://www.ksa.ch/aerzte-fachaerzte/dr-med-evgenia-bousouni). Partial hysterectomy & bilateral salpingectomy. 24F, married for 3 years, both me & my husband are CF (we don’t have kids and we never want them). No bingos at all, neither by the doc nor the hospital staff. I had to wait for my first appt for 2 months, but had surgery 3 days after my initial consultation. Insurance covered all costs (it would‘ve cost approx $2k if I had paid out of pocket). The doc even offered a hysterectomy although I only asked for a bisalp („so I don’t have to deal with periods anymore“), so I felt taken care of & understood & respected for my wishes.

[Dr. Irène Dingeldein](https://www.local.ch/en/d/murten/3280/gynaecology-and-obstetrics/dr-med-dingeldein-irene-gdCjCT4A_kmqPqh-HSm0xw). She did a bilateral salpingectomy on me (25yo), but required me to get an attest by a psychiatric before.

Dr. Med. Paolo Sommaruga Adress: Via Pietro Peri 2, 6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland. Phone: +41.91.923.65.45 Email: studiosommaruga.lalia@gmail.com. 

Frauenarzt Zürich Stadelhofen Dr. med. Florian C. Hirzel Stadelhoferstrasse 8, 8001 Zürich. I had tubal litigation with him, and then later partial hysterectomy with bisalp. He will ask you multiple times if you are sure and have you sign a paper, but he will do it because it's legally required in Switzerland. Surgery is usually scheduled quite fast in Klinik Hirslanden - both times I had to wait 2-3 months tops.

### Slovakia

- [Dr Roman Sokol](http://www.vazektomia.sk/), Trenčín. Dr Sokol did not question my decision to get a vasectomy at 32 years old without having children, providing my wife and I signed a piece of paper saying we understood what the vasectomy entailed. He speaks English and the 16 minute operation was absolutely painless and I needed no ice needed afterwards. 

- Gynpor Sliač s.r.o., SNP 9, 962 31  Sliač, www.gynpor.sk, 045 / 532 68 50, galad@gynpor.sk. UNCONFIRMED! To share your experience please edit this entry.

- Mediklinik - CS Salvus s.r.o., ul. 29. Augusta 2, 934 01 Levice, 00421 903 463 425, info@mediklinik.sk. Confirmed to perform tubal ligation (likely with clips, NO bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy on elective basis) for 18+. 

- Gyneka Trenčín (http://www.gyneka.sk/) Dr.Jankovský respected my decision despite me not having any kids, he didn't want to hear any lengthy arguments, only that I am absolutely sure I want this. Excellent team and professional work, the operation was a breeze.


### Sweden
- [Basima Saadun](https://www.aleris.se/vara-medarbetare/B/Basima-Saadun/). Nacka Sjukhus, about 30 minutes east of Stockholm. She simply made sure I understood the procedure (tubal ligation) was permanent, asked me my reasons for wanting to have the procedure done and had me sign the paper. Waiting times can be a bit long since it is an elective surgery. She was very friendly and didn't question my decision at all. My age was 25 at the time.

- [Anna Marie Kanold](https://sodermalmslakarhus.se/) Also at Nacka Sjukhus gynolocology.  Very straightforward.  Asked questions about whether I understood that it was permanent, if I had children, and if my partner agreed with this choice, but didn't give any pressure and accepted all of my answers at face value. My age was 32. 

- [Gastro Center Skåne](https://skane.gastrocenter.se/behandlingar/urologi) for those living in Southern Sweden for vasectomies. You need to first get a Swedish "remiss", which is easy to get, just request one via the [contact email on this page](https://vardgivare.skane.se/vardriktlinjer/njur-och-urinvagssjukdomar/ako/sterilisering-hos-man/#ICD-10-SE) and motivate a little bit why you want one (this link applies for people living in Skåne, if you live in a different region, you need to find the page specific to your area). NOTE: you must be 25 years or older in Sweden to get sterilized. You can get sterilized at an earlier age, but only really if there are true medical reasons for doing so. According to Swedish law, you can not be denied sterialization after the age of 25. It helps to be able to articulate why you want to be sterilized, however the law is quite clear that clinics and doctors break the law if they deny you after the age of 25. I got a time at the Gastro clinic where the doctor was very much pro childfree, and then could get the operation done very fast only a few days thereafter. They use the scalpel version of the operation, cut out a decent chunk of the vas def, burn the tips and sew the ends and put a couple disolvable stiches the close up the testicles. Both doctors and nurses were extremely nice, helpful and supportive before, during and after the procedure. If you want the non-scalpel version (extremely difficult to find in Sweden), a redditor tipped me to [Dalslands Kliniken](http://dalslandskliniken.se/index.php/urologi/) as they mention on their page that they do the no-scalpel procedure. I do not know clinics for women, however you have a legal right to the operation, so just find the page to get a "remiss" in your region after you turn 25 and you will get a time to talk to a doctor guaranteed. Hopefully this info helps someone!

### Ukraine

- [Androcentr Kiev](http://androcentr.kiev.ua/) There's been many good reviews of their vasectomy practice, both the preparations and the operation itself. The performing doctor has appeared on Russian TV in a talk show about childfree people. I'm 20 and have a scheduled appointment.

##United Kingdom

Anyone in the UK seeking a vasectomy can go direct to BPAS: https://www.bpas.org/. They will do it privately (self referral) or for free if your NHS doctor refers you to the service.

### England

Bristol - [Dr Doron Boone](https://www.bristolvasectomyclinic.com/). Fascial interposition vasectomy completed. 32yo, separated with no kids. Sent an enquiry through the website and was phoned back within 24hrs. Short conversation with the doctor then was emailed FAQ information and booking form. Wait to appt was less than 1 month. Private procedure so cost £695 (July 2022). 20min appt with counsellor before procedure to check in, but was very supportive. Procedure itself took 15mins and was only mildly unpleasant.

[Dr. Martin Kittel](https://vasectomy.me.uk/), *No-Scalpel Vasectomy*. We did have to pay up-front for this, and we had to fill out 2 questionnaires: one for being from out of the country, and the other because we don't have (or want) kids. Just be honest and up-front; our choices were not questioned here, they just want to be sure that you're sure as they go on a case-by-case basis. The doctor was excellent and very professional, and they have a great staff.

Mrs Kalaivani Lingham, Consultant Gynaecologist/Urogynaecologist.  Consults out of The Burton Clinic in Burton on Trent, Nuffield Hospital Derby in Derby and Spire Little Aston Hospital in Sutton Coldfield.  Her secretary's number is 01283 566 333 ext 4378 to make an appointment.  I saw her for bleeding problems for nearly a year before I decided I just wanted a hysterectomy and be done with it.  She is very nice and very professional, and only asked the obligatory 'are you sure?'.  She told me she respects people who chose not to have children as they've put a lot more thought into it than most people who have them, she's never had anyone she's sterilised come back regretting it, and although she has children herself said she had them when she was 'young and naive' and if she'd known then what she knows now she wouldn't have had them.  I saw her privately at the Nuffield using my private medical insurance, I don't know if she does NHS cases at Burton or Sutton Coldfield. 

Miss Jilly Lloyd, Consultant Gynaecologist/Obstetrician. She works with the NHS out of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London. She is very nice and professional and made me feel very respected - my choice was not questioned. She informed me about how the operation would be performed, that is is intended to be irreversible and that there is a small chance of failure. My young age and nulliparity never came into the conversation. I had my pre-operative assessment for tubal ligation the same day. Overall, amazing doctor.

Dr Austin Ugwumadu Consultant Gynaecologist/Obstetrician. Works for the NHS in St Georges Hospital Tooting (South West London). Very lovely man, asked me questions for about 5 minutes and then said he'd sterilise me. Says that women should be able to decide if they want children or not and that he wouldn't say no to someone purely because of her age (obviously you need to be over 18), won't even ask you if you have a partner or if they're OK with you having it done as to him it doesn't matter. Didn't utter a single bingo or allude to them. Does them mainly as day cases but if you have other health problems they will admit you overnight to be safe. From my appointment to operation date was less than 3 months (would be sooner but I have to spend the night in hospital)

-1 Dr Ugwumadu  "I contacted one of the doctor of the list and his secretary told me that he doesn't sterilise women and won't even consider doing it to this option to someone as young as me (I'll be 29 soon)". This may be a case of a secretary rather than the doctor being childfree unfriendly. 

Michael Stafford, Chelsea and Westminster hospital, Chelsea, London, U.K. www.chelwest.nhs.uk. Procedure: laparoscopic bilateral female sterilisation, single 32 year old female with no children. Clip method used. No choice of type of laparoscopy given. Fully covered under the NHS. This is the only female sterilisation covered by the NHS. Current waitlist : 3-9 months. After years of trying to get drs to listen I finally convinced one to refer me to a gynaecology department. The doctor I spoke to was kind, not condescending, and while he did clearly have a list of offensive questions, it didn’t feel personally negative. He approved me right away and wrote a letter to request sterilisation. The staff on site on the day were amazing on the day! No odd question and no second guessing. The procedure it self just happened. Full general and local anaesthesia was used and I woke up feeling good. Sadly after 30 minutes I had some reactions to the anaesthesia which was vomiting and I couldn’t pee for about 5 hours which is rare and they almost had to do a catheter but it was fine for me to go home same day. They gave me codeine for pain and laxatives. Due to the anaesthesia I felt less well then expected, as though I was getting over the flu. I went back to an office job after five days and had normal discomfort and was more tired then usual. Stitches healed after a day or two. Amazing experience and I would highly recommend the gynaecology team at Chelsea Westminster hospital.

Ms Nadine Di Donato, Consultant Gynaecologist and Laparoscopic Surgeon. She works with The Harley Street Clinic in London. Her medical secretary told me she was happy to see me (early 20s) about sterilisation but advised she would have to follow the NICE guidelines. I sent in my binder prior to the appointment. Ms Di Donato was incredibly nice and friendly and made me feel validated and respected for the first time in my pursuit of sterilisation. I could not recommend her more. She was fine to sterilise me but because of my age I was referred to her colleague for a second opinion. They were very nice and respectful as well and happy to support my decision. Surgery was scheduled quickly and went without a hitch. Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have found this amazing doctor.

Mr Ian Cameron works from Gateshead Queen Elizabeth Hospital for the NHS. He agreed to a bisalp with no issues after checking my understanding of the procedure. He mentioned at the time of surgery he had another 8 people on the list for the same surgery for the Protector Study. The protector study is for people with BRCA1/2 who are at higher risk, has the option of no surgery, bisalp with or without a delayed oophorectomy or a bisalp and oophorectomy at the same time. He agreed to the surgery regardless of whether I wanted to be part of the study. It is as yet unclear if Mr Cameron will sterilise medically healthy people. 

[Dr. Stephan Ramnarine](https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/service/gynaecology/), with consultations with Mr. Edward Johnson and Mr. Kevin Hayes, London - St George's Hospital, Tooting. Bilateral Salpingectomy on a 33yo. The procedure was fully covered by the NHS, and all the specialists I consulted with were extremely professional - they took their time to ensure I was certain about the decision, but were very polite and respectful of my autonomy. The full wait time between seeing my GP for the initial referral and the procedure was about 8 months. I wasn't encouraged / asked to get an IUD, or to try any other forms of birth control. 

Runcorn - Dr Kay, Halton Hospital, Hospital Way, Palacefields, Runcorn WA7 2DA. Scalpel vasectomy, 19yo. We had to request this through our GP surgery, and they referred us to the service. We had to have 1 telephone "counselling session" which we both had to be present for to see if they thought we were suitable, they asked us questions like what if we change our minds, what if we split up and why didn't I (female) get my tubes tied instead (wish that was an option!). Once they were happy that we understood that it was unlikely it could be reversed and the risks involved, they booked us in there and then. The lady who did the counselling session was a bit condescending but was no match for my husband, who had prepared answers for any questions they might have asked. On the day we had a little pre op where they informed us of the risks, aftercare, and the follow-up tests to check that it was successful. No one questioned our age or our decision. He had to wait for 30mins in recovery alone (the nurse came out to let me know he was OK) and then we were on our way. I think we were less than an hour in the hospital.

Manchester - MSI UK Manchester (M65QX) was the center I got my vasectomy at, but they seem to operate UK wide and explicitly say they don't reject anyone based on age, children, or marital status. They offer NHS and private treatment (GBP550). Everyone at the treatment center was very respectful and accommodating, despite being 20 minutes late, didn't cancel my appointment. No judgement from the nurse or the surgeon, I was treated like any other patient. The nurse said they believe that it's entirely my choice. My referral (needed if I wanted the NHS to pay for it) was made by Fallowfield medical center (M14 6YL), Dr. Smith was respectful of my opinion and didn't make me feel judged, she just wanted to make sure that I won't change my mind, and I knew what I was getting into.

Kent - [Mr Ben Eddy](https://www.bmihealthcare.co.uk/consultants/ben-andrew-eddy). Male, 29, Kent UK. Scalpel Vasectomy, paid about £1000 privately, inclusive of subsequent sperm analysis and follow ups. Professional, courteous, friendly, and not a single bingo. When asked if my age was a problem, he replied “not a problem with me, you’re an adult and it’s entirely your decision.” Made sure I was comfortable and I wasn’t being forced into it, and did a bang-up job of the procedure.

Bournemouth - [Mr Ash Monga and Dr Keith Louden](https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/consultants/mr-ash-monga) Nuffield Health Care, Bournemouth. Bilateral Salpingectomy on 26yo, done privately.  "The consultations cost £200 a pop, and with the surgery and one night stay the whole thing cost £5000."

Leeds - [DR A Burkill, Priory View Medical Centre](https://www.prioryviewmedicalcentre.co.uk/practice-information/meet-the-team/). Scalpel vasectomy under local anaesthesia and tying the vas deferens instead of cauterising. Unmarried, age: 24, 0 children, male. Had to get a GP referral to be granted the vasectomy. After that had a short 20 minute call with practitioner to verify I definitely wanted it, as well as explaining the procedure in all detail with possible after effects. Appointment for procedure was booked 60 days from initial phone call and had to sign consent and liability forms. Offers sedation for anxious patients. 

Leeds - MSI Choices. March 2023. Vasectomy on CF redditor. Only had to have a quick consultation for being under 25, but besides that, really faced no hassle for my age. 

Dorset - Dr Webster. He has already approved and performed a bi-salp on me.

Coventry - [Dr Smruta Shanbhag](https://www.finder.bupa.co.uk/Consultant/view/159589/dr_smruta_shanbhag), BMI Meriden Hospital Walsgrave Hospital Clifford Bridge Road Coventry CV2 2LQ 024 7766 47064. I had an bilateral salpingectomy by this lovely doctor in 2019. She listened to me (20F), didn’t bingo me, said as long as I signed the consent to procedure form she was happy to proceed. I used my health insurance but she will do some work on the NHS too. 

Oxford - [Ms Lee Lim](https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/consultants/dr-lee-lim) Beech Road, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7RP. Note: you do not require a referral from a GP to access Ms. Lim’s services. April 2023. Bisalp on 32 year old CF woman. Doctor was willing to be educated on the dangers of Filshie clips, and to provide bisalp for sterilization instead – one of the few in the UK to do so. She has been nothing but amazing and supportive of my CF choices.

Edinburgh Dr. Cameron Martin. 0131 316 2530 cameronwmartin@yahoo.co.uk He works with the NHS out of the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, but also will do salpingectomy through Spire. Cost was £3100. Did salpingectomy on 30-year-old woman who had to travel to get the surgery. Was willing to do screening over the phone. He will want you to be clear about what you're asking for, so do your research first. He's a very pleasant doctor to work with, and is very thorough. [User experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/87iygn/bilateral_salpingectomy_experience_uk_xposted/)

+1 Dr Cameron Martin.  Performed a bisalp on me at 27 without hesitation and without any bingos. He is clearly knowledgeable and keeps up to date with scientific literature. Very friendly and uncomplicated. It cost me around £3900 including any pre- and aftercare appointments. 

+1 Dr. Cameron Martin. Bisalp on 22-year-old redditor. He was absolutely amazing and from the first consultation was so good, completely non judgemental and was just such a friendly person who put me completely at ease.

+1 For Dr. Martin in Edinburgh, Scotland. 24, married. Entirely accepting of my decision to have a bisalp (procedure carried out May 2023), no bingos. Traveled from Ireland to Scotland, quick zoom meeting and then was happy to schedule.

[Sarah Demediuk and Nick Demediuk](https://drsnip.com.au/), founders of Dr Snip, have locations all over Australia. 

Dr Marie - Marie Stopes International - http://www.drmarie.org.au/ - I got mine done when I was 28. I made an appointment, paid and got it done on the same day. The Doctor did offer me the chance to talk to someone to make sure I was okay with it, but it was more of show/legalities. Everything went great! 

NB Marie Stopes has the following requirements for patients seeking vasectomy, "'Are you under 30 years of age with no children? All clients under 30 years of age with no children need to be referred directly to counselling prior to the booking being confirmed. '" Male sterilization/vasectomy info is at https://www.vasectomy.org.au/.

+1 Marie Stopes, Melbourne (East St Kilda), 31M, Vasectomy done with local anesthetic. Friendly staff, surgeon uses open ended method and close towards the vas, which (supposedly) is less likely to cause congestion pain.

-1 Marie Stopes: Vasectomy was denied based on age (21) by doctor despite positive assessment from in-house psychologist. 

-1 Marie Stopes (Sydney): I told the nurse I wanted tubal ligation. She dismissed the idea, and pushed hormonal contraceptives. The surgeon saw that I asked about tubal ligation. As he read my file in front of me, he literally scoffed and mumbled, "well that's not going to happen". I don't remember his name, but he made me so uncomfortable that I almost walked out. n.b. [Marie Stopes only offers tubal ligation in Western Australia](https://www.mariestopes.org.au/contraception/tubal-ligation/).

**Western Australia**

- Perth - [Dr Todd Ladanchuk from WA Gynae & Surgery](https://wagynaesurgery.com.au/index.html) who didn’t bingo me once about my decision and after a quick discussion to confirm I’d considered my other BC options he had me booked in the next month. 30NB. I wanted a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (and got that) and Dr Ladanchuk agreed that that is the most common version of sterilisation he does nowadays. Dr Ladanchuk also has a great bedside manner and was super comfortable to talk to about all the questions you might have! I also live in regional WA and was able to organise everything through phone consults and email. I used my private health insurance so I went to Hollywood Private Hospital and paid only my insurance excess for the hospital. The surgeon fees were $200 post-rebate for the consult and ~$900 out of pocket for the surgery, which included my Implanon removal at the same time as my sterilisation. Anaesthetist fees were $400. All of the hospital staff were delightful and I didn’t get bingoed once.  LGBTQIA+ side note: Hollywood Private’s computer system allows for gender neutral honorifics so I got to have Mx. on my name band! 

- Perth - [Catherine Harris](https://www.drharris.com.au), Suite 1 60 Arnisdale Road Duncraig, WA 6023. +61 (08) 92433500. I am 36 years old. She asked if I was sure and when I said yes didn’t push any further or require any other psych appts etc. I was able to book in on the spot and she does not charge any health fund gap, does require you to have top cover though. Very friendly and non judgemental. Wait time for appt was 1 month, surgery booked for 3 weeks from now.

- Perth - Dr. Phillip Snowball - Perth Vasectomy clinic - http://www.perthvasectomyclinic.com.au/ If you're particularly young (18 or so) he likes you to have psychiatric evaluation, which I found was easy to obtain. The psychiatrist I saw was a man called Kevin O'Daly in Fremantle. Dr Michael Beckett also does vasectomies here. His says he has no problem performing them for any male over 30 so you should have zero trouble if you're over 30.

- Perth - Dr. Michael Beckett - Beaumaris Family Practice - https://beaumarisfp.com.au/doctors/dr-michael-beckett/ I went as a 30 year old and after a very friendly chat about him making sure I knew what I was getting myself in for, confirming that I really didn't want kids, and I had a rough idea of what I wanted in life, he basically said that at 30 I am adult and can make my own decisions

- Perth - Dr. Ann Yoong - 133 Edward St Perth/St John of God Mt Lawley - https://www.sjog.org.au/find-a-doctor/search-results/y/o/o/n/yoong-annfuien-mtlawley 29/F, went in for severe PCOS and chronic bleeding. She recommended an IUD right off the bat without any prompting. She bulk bills whenever possible, and I only wound up paying about $235 for my visit to her, the short hospital stay and all following check ups. Keep note, she's a little bit quirky, but very friendly and easy to talk to. Also sex-worker friendly!

- Perth - Dr. Roger Perkins - Suite 7/10 McCourt St, West Leederville WA 6007 - https://rogerperkins.com.au/ 25/F, I received a referral from two doctors from South Street Family Star Medical: Dr Vasanth Govindappa and Sherina De Almeida. Almeida was more reluctant to agree, but I refused to budge and she gave me the referral. Roger Perkins was quite reluctant to immediately agree to doing the surgery, and required me to see Suzanne Midford first. Midford is a clinical psychologist specialising in adoption situations. After the assessment came back perfectly fine, obviously, Perkins readily agreed to the surgery. As a surgeon, I believe he is one of the best: I basically had no pain during recovery from the inscisions or gas. I took one Panadeine Forte the afternoon after the operation, and literally no other pain killers during recovery because I felt zero pain, just physical discomfort from feeling uncomfortably full. The hoops I had to jump through just to get him as my surgeon: worth it. 

- Perth - [Dr. Rose McDonnell](https://www.drrosemcdonnell.com.au/) completed a bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal) for me at the age of 36. I’m childfree by choice, never been pregnant. She did require a psychiatric evaluation / report first and had a substantial gap free. She pushed contraception but I refused it all (medical reasons for not being suitable for it). She also said “at least you can have IVF when you change your mind”. But she did it at least. At least she didn’t ask what my partner thought about it. This doctor will likely be unfriendly to younger members and should be used with caution. 

- Dr. Kathrine Penrose - Murdoch Gynecology - https://www.drkatherinepenrose.com.au/ - Really lovely doctor who helped me get diagnosed with PCOS as well as performed my bilateral salpingectomy. She first said no to the sterilisation because of my age (21) but I came back with a letter from my psychiatrist verifying my autism and supporting my choice of sterilisation after which she agreed. During the discussion she said that she’s absolutely sterilised women under 30 years old but was very hesitant to do a 21 year old but that my condition made me a unique case. Overall a great experience with her and have I since recommended her to friends and family seeking a good gyno.

- Dr Geoffrey McCallum, Boronia Vic 3155, Australia. (03) 9761 0444 http://www.obs-gyn.com - performed bi-salp on the 11th November 2020 on 29/30 year old without issues. 

- Melbourne - www.drsnip.com.au - All the relevant information is on their website. Come prepared with either a letter from a local GP or Psychologist stating you are of sound mind or be well prepared to justify your decision to the surgeon himself. He's a nice guy but is more then willing to interrogate you beforehand just to cover himself legally.

- Melbourne - Dr Judith Fleming - Epworth Cliveden Private Consulting Suites, East Melbourne : 03 9419 3477.  Regional location: Colac Hospital (Colac VIC 3250) : 03 419 3477.  I had my consult at Cliveden and will be having my procedure there in late November.  Very respectful of an individuals self-autonomy and being able to make such a choice but want to make sure you are aware a hysterectomy is permanent.  I will be just a month shy of 33 at the time of my procedure. *Update 15 March 2022 - Dr Fleming may be retiring in June. 

- Ballarat - Dr Kate Stewart - fully supports bodily autonomy and is happy to talk to women seeking sterilisation. 

- Melbourne - Dr Jude McNaughton - Jean Hailes For Women's Health (Clayton). 03 9562 7555. I got an IUD at the age of 25. She offered other contraceptive options but ultimately respected my choice and was happy to replace with another one in 5 years time when it expires. Not sure about sterilisation but she is open minded and respectful.

Update 15 March 2022 - Dr McNaughton may have retired - currently waiting on confirmation. 

- Mornington -  Dr Sarah Roberts at the Bays Hospital in Mornington, Victoria, Australia. I was approved at 28. I am a cis female, and was single at the time. The doctor did explore other options for contraception (that was mainly based on some medical problems I had), but accepted me. I got this done under the public health system, and had both fallopian tubes removed. I waited about a year. I spoke to the other surgeons and they were willing to approve people 30 and older - mine was a borderline case.

- Melbourne - [A/Prof Alex Ades](https://www.advancedgynaecologymelbourne.com.au/assoc-prof-alex-ades) (03) 9347 7100. He is a very nice and thoughtful doctor. Will not provide permanent contraception for under 25's. +2. 

- Melbourne - [Dr Alex Polyakov](https://www.dralexpolyakov.com.au/gynaecology/contraception/) - Suite 4/320 Victoria Parade, East Melbourne VIC 3002. 03 9486 0677. Sterilised a 28 year old with clips after reinforcing a couple of times that it would be permanent. Update (March 2020): I (20) was refused Bisalp, saying I was too young, he said that he usually only does 25+ years old, bonus points for having a husband.

- Melbourne - Dr Emma Readman - https://dremmareadman.com.au/ She is a really nice and caring gynae, she also does a lot of pain and endo/ adenomyosis management. From that point of view, she likes to preserve fertility but she is also really open to discussing contraception, including sterilisation. I (20) went to her for a Bilateral Salpingectomy in March 2020, She was pretty open about it and we spent a long time discussing it, the end result was that she was happy to continue to talk to me about it and said to have another talk to her in 4 or 5 months and then if I was still sure, she would book me in. I feel that if I had persisted with her, she would have booked me in from the second consultation. Be careful, her receptionist will probably bingo you, but its worth it.

-1 Dr Readman, "She was almost combatative with me regarding a hysterectomy and even after my endometriosis surgery which showed signs of adenomyosis she completely refused to acknowledge my request for a hyster and concerns regarding my uterus. "

+1 Dr Readman, Procedure performed early 2022 - total laproscopic hysterectomy including removal of tubes. Left hosp next day (at 27yo, approved at 26). Unmarried with bf of 4 yrs. Was approved after initial consult (however i had also pre-sent a letter of support by a psychiatrist - during consult i was told this is generally a requirement they asked for before approving such procedures). She was respectful, non-judgemental, understanding and incredibly caring. I would highly recommend. Hysterectomy was elective/for contraceptive purposes with no underlying medical issues. 

[Dr Andrew Stirling](https://www.metrocentre.com.au/our-team/) - 118 Wellington Parade, East Melbourne VIC 3002. I'm 23 yrs old male, in a relationship, childfree. Did the procedure after a quick consultation & I didn't have any problems. Dr didn't have any qualms about performing the procedure on a young guy & if your single or childfree all you have to do is sign an extra consent form to proceed. Dr talked about how he has had young patients & childfree couples in the past.

[Professor Thomas Jobling](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services/20047950/assoc-prof-thomas-jobling-brighton/services/brighton-3186-bay). Completed total hysterectomy + bisalp July 2020 (during second lockdown!). I was 29F, male partner (unmarried), both childless. Very knowledgeable, down to earth and realistic. Private, OOP cost was ~$200 for consultation and ~$3k for surgery (with PH). Mainly does gyn oncology and fertility preservation, but very open to sterilisation for pain management. I had ongoing uterine spasms and pain (no endo found) + PCOS and recurring torsions. I did find he would talk over me or ignore what I said at times so having my (male) partner there was great for emotional support and another voice. Also a couple of bingos but mostly tongue in cheek and/or emphasising permanence. Use with caution as this doctor may not be willing to move forward on a purely elective basis. 

**Queensland**

- Brisbane - Dr Greg Silver of Vasectomy Clinic Brisbane

- Brisbane - Dr Stephanie Robinson of Chatswood Road Medical Centre in Daisy Hill : 07 3208 8622 : She is qualified to insert IUDs in the office and there is a medicare covered portion for the procedure, the office also bulk bills. Happy to discuss all birth control options, regardless of age or marital status etc. She is an amazingly sweet lady and thorough GP as well.

- Brisbane - Dr Sumar at the Kallangur Medical Centre. I had my Implanon changed out with her and she gave me details for the Salisbury Clinic (listed above) She is fantastic, would highly recommend. 

- Brisbane - Dr Robert Burns, operates at multiple locations in Brisbane. I saw him at Aspley Medical Centre and had a very positive experience.  He admitted me for a vasectomy after one consultation and only asked that I get somebody who has known me for a long time to contact him to confirm my stable mental state.  He was very open and clear and supportive in discussions and was not judgmental in any way.

- Brisbane - Dr Jamie Friebe, North West Private Hospital in Everton Park. Happy to perform a tubal ligation at 26 after two consultations. Also performed a tubal for my friend at 30. No major issues, asked why I wanted the procedure done, asked how my partner felt (but no official partner consent required), asked about other BC I'd tried. Was overall friendly and accommodating 🙂

- +1 Dr Friebe, Tubal ligation and endometrial ablation, 37, married long term, child free. 2 week wait for initial consult with a referral from my GP. Surgery a week after consult. Approx: out of pocket after insurance and Medicare: $500 for gyno surgery fees, $695 for anaesthesia, $750 hospital.

- -1 Dr. Friebe  March 2023. Was happy to do a tubal ligation but refused to consider a bilateral salpingectomy on anyone younger than 40, citing that the tubal ligation, whilst considered permanent, was more reversible than the salpingectomy. Also refused to discuss the failure rate and instead cited his own success rate.

- -1 Dr Jamie Friebe, Brisbane. He was happy to perform a tubal ligation on me after two consultations. I provided evidence about a bilateral salpingectomy being more effective. He agreed that tubal ligations are flawed however ultimately refused to provide a bisalp based on the finality of the procedure and my age (30F). While he does offer tubals I did not feel like he fully supported my reproductive autonomy.
 
- Brisbane Southside -  "Salisbury Day Surgery" Providing numerous services for women, including contraception, terminations, sterilisations. Doctor over the phone was absolutely lovely and there was zero judgment regarding conversations about being sterilised. Very professional. Pushing women's rights to be childfree. http://www.salisburydaysurgery.com.au/~~ **The Salisbury Day Surgery is CLOSED 5/5/2020

- Brisbane (multiple locations in town) - "The Vasectomist" Dr. Dick Beatty, https://thevasectomist.com.au/ 

- Brisbane - Dr Darren Po at Redland Hospital in Cleveland. Said he was pro choice in my appointment with him and he didn't ask any reasons why, just made sure that I understood it is permanent.

- Dr Kate McDonald of Springwood General Practice can insert IUDs and was very respectful of my CF decision when talking about possible outcomes for long term contraception. Be prepared to explain your stance but she is polite, professional and easy to talk to, and held no opposition to my decision.

- Brisbane - Dr Melanie Burnet of Greenslopes Women's Wellbeing Clinic. Respectful, professional, thorough. They do IUDs there too.

- Pomona (QLD) Dr Ann Buchan at Cooroora Family Health is very supportive of the CF life. Respects choices about sterilization and fertility options. Is very good with women's health, and is an all-round amazing doctor

- Toowoomba GP Dr Captan Beck at Seven Springs Medical Centre is very friendly, approachable and completely supportive of childfree people. This practice does not bulk bill to my knowledge.

- Toowoomba Women's Health Only, Medici Medical Centre, 201/15 Scott St, East Toowoomba QLD. Dr Lanziz Homar. Very friendly and a straight forward consultation. Park on the street if you don't want to be charged for parking. Surgery performed at St. Andrews. Consultation was $160 (10h 40m) 11 July 2016 &amp;amp;amp; Medicare rebate applies.

- [Dr Brad Armstrong](https://www.gsog.com.au/) of Greenslopes Obstetrics and Gynaecology. He performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me (26f, married, completely childfree - never had/wanted children). Visiting this practice is expensive as they don't bulk bill, but you do get some money back through the Medicare rebate. He will make you get a second opinion consult and see a psychologist if you are young and have no children, but if these come back fine he will do the procedure.

- +1 Dr Brad Armstrong, Greenslopes Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Brisbane. He performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me (30F, straight, with long term partner, no children). He was professional and respectful. Dr Armstrong took his time in hearing my justification and took copies of my supporting notes. He required a second opinion with another OB/GYN and a psychological evaluation, both done through his practice. I attended 4 appointments in total before I could book the procedure, but found all the staff to be super lovely and supportive.

**New South Wales**

- Sydney (CBD) Dr Surya Krishnan - OBGYN - Sydney, Australia https://www.sydneywomensclinic.com.au/about/dr-surya-krishnan-obstetrician-sydney/ I had a full hysterectomy performed. I am 31f, unmarried, no children. He was genuinely lovely, he agreed to my hysterectomy at my initial consult with no arguments or bingo-ing. Did mention that if I was 19 he would have been less comfortable doing the surgery but at 31 it was completely my choice. My wait from initial consult to surgery was about two months, however it could have been sooner had I wanted. The surgery cost me $3900 all up, the surgeons fee was $2200, after insurance and Medicare.

- Sydney (CBD) Dr Ai Nhi Bui - GP - Sydney, Australia https://www.hydeparkmc.com.au Provided my referral to my hysterectomy surgeon. She is incredibly lovely, was upset to hear that I’d had issues in the past trying to get sterilisation surgery and was happy to refer me straight away. Bulk bills her regular patients, new patients are privately billed.

- Sydney (North Sydney) Dr Rajdeep Ubeja at North Sydney Medical Centre and Skin Cancer Clinic. Had a 10 minute discussion about why I wanted the procedure and the risks and then gave me a referral to see a specialist at the RPA Sexual Health Clinic. Is also a bulk billing practice.

- Sydney (Chatswood) http://gynaecare.com.au/

- Sydney (Turramurra) GP - Dr Amanda Wildsmith at Kissing Point Road Family Doctors. Dr Wildsmith is a fantastic GP who had no hesitation in drawing up a referral for me to discuss permanent contraception. She is very kind, professional and a great GP if you live in the area. 

- Sydney (Chatswood) GP - Susan McSweeney from Clinic 66 in Chatswood. She was a little hesitant because I don’t think many people had ever asked her for that type of referral but supported me seeking autonomy for my body completely. 

- Sydney (Bondi) Bilateral Salpingectomy - [Dr David Rosen](https://www.drdr.com.au) He completed my bilateral salpingectomy on myself a childfree woman in 20s. No guilt, no bingos. He simply said ‘you know your body best, let’s book this in for you’. There was the option for publicly funded but I self funded to speed up the process. I cannot recommend him enough.

+1 Dr Rosen, I booked with Dr Rosen with intent to obtain a full hysterectomy (25, CF). I explained my reasoning was relief for persistent pcos complications, a desire to live childfree, and to relieve my gender dysphoria. He informed me that my request was quite severe for the issues I was experiencing and offered me some other solutions such as birth control. When I refused those options, he offered me a total hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy and informed me of the risk/benefit of both. Dr Rosen asserted that despite his hesitation, it is my body and I have ultimate agency over how Id like to proceed. He required me to produce a letter from my psychologist claiming I am of sane mind and capable to make the decision. I was put on hormone blockers for two months to simulate menopause and treat it with HRT so I would have a stable hormone balance pre established before surgery. 3.5 months after our first meeting I successfully underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy + bilateral salpingooophorectomy with morcellation with Dr Rosen in a private hospital. My appointments + surgery were all eligible for rebate from my private health-fund as well as medicare. Dr Rosen's receptionist was more than happy to help me obtain the rebate. NB OP had other medical indications for the hysterectomy/oophorectomy and this doctor may not be willing to perform this surgery on a purely elective basis. 

- Sydney (Newtown) (Po-Yu Huang)[https://www.healthshare.com.au/profile/professional/108254-dr-po-yu-huang/#overview]. Has two offices, one in Newtown and one in Sydney CBD.  Bilateral salpingectomy Very respectful and no bingos. Asked me (24F at the time) once for my reasons why I don't want children and accepted it when I said I just instinctively don't. I think it helped that I'd written a 4 page essay (with references) outlining all my reasons why I don't want children, why I was choosing a bilateral salpingectomy specifically (possibly reduces risk of ovarian cancer) and why I didn't want other birth control methods. Had my surgery scheduled and performed within a month after the initial consult.

- Sydney (Wahroonga) Tubal Ligation/Salpingectomy - [Dr Kris Urbaniak at Sydney Adventist Hospital.](https://sah.org.au/krisurbaniak) I was referred to him by Dr Wildsmith above after Dr Anne Pike retired. Very gentle and sensitive and will listen to you and work with you to find a solution that works best for you. He asked me once if I (26 F) was certain that I wanted it and understood the risks, and then went through the procedure with me. SAH is a wonderful but private hospital so prepare for costs. Dr Urbaniak has since refused to sterilise a 20 F in 2019. 

- Sydney (Randwick) Dr Jason Abbott at Alana Healthcare. http://www.alanahealthcare.com.au/. With a minimal amount of consultations to isolate the problem he agreed to perform a Hysterectomy on my 33Yr old wife to get rid of her chronic pain. He did first do a laproscopic endometrial ablation, but when that didn't fix the problem he asked us once clearly if we were sure about no children, then said no more about it and agreed to the procedure. His exact words were "If two is the right number for your family, then it's not my place to try and convince you otherwise". Couldn't be happier with the whole experience. 

- Sydney (Kirrawee) [Dr Gemma Urch](https://www.kirraweefmp.com.au/our-team) She is a GP & was happy to refer me to a gynaecologist at either a public or private hospital. She empathised & expressed frustration at how difficult it can be for people to get this procedure. I paid $50 for the appointment total after the Medicare rebate. About Me: I was 30yo & married when she referred me, and I’m CF

- Sydney (Enmore), Dr Geoff Cashion Sydney Vasectomy Centre @ Enmore Medical Practice 134-146 Enmore Rd NSW 2042 Enmore NSW 2042. He was really good! If you're under 30 you need to do 1 counselling session I believe. I was 30 so didn't need to. He asked if I had kids I said I didn't and he said "I guess you want to keep it that way haha". Felt very comfortable. Total cost was $100 deposit and $650 at the clinic. Medicare refunded about $220 so roughly $550 out of pocket. Took about 30-40 mins from walking in front door to talking out.

- Central Coast NSW: https://www.drfarag.com.au/ - Dr Farag performed a bilateral salpingectomy for my 38 year old wife (2019).  She had two specialist visits with him, one to get her questions answered as she wasn't completely sure if she wanted to go ahead and the second to confirm the procedure and book the operation.  He confirmed that she was sure and also suggested if she ever changed her mind she could come back as he does IVF as well!  He did not charge any gap above what private health insurance charged, she had no hospital fees and only had to pay the gap for the Anaesthesiologist.  He is based in Gosford currently and works out of Gosford Private Hospital.  Being a specialist, a referral is needed from your GP first.

- Wollongong - Dr Joe McCosker http://www.drmccosker.com.au/gynaecology

- Wollongong (Shellharbour) - Dr Brian Stewart. Best doctor I've had overall in my life and also gave me (24M) my referral with no resistance once I mentioned I wanted to focus on my career and that my partner didn't want to rear children. Referral was to a Wollongong Urologist who hopefully takes medicare and will be equally accepting 31/8/19. 

- Maitland - Dr. Peter Soaki OB/GYN UNIT 2/14 Elgin Street, Maitland, NSW, Australia (02) 4933 3299 He doesn't have his own website, but [this site](https://www.healthshare.com.au/profile/professional/108569-dr-peter-soaki/) shows what hospitals he works at or is affiliated with. Mid-20's. I got Bilateral Salpingectomy and (Novasure) Endometrial Ablation. You must have a referral from a GP to see him, as he is a specialist, and it helps to have a written letter so that someone else has kind of 'assessed you' before turning up. He and my GP said they would normally never refer or perform these surgeries on someone who had no children and was in their mid-twenties, but because I had done my research and could answer everything quite confidently and easily, they could tell it was what I truly wanted. So even if he performed the surgeries on me, if he looks someone over and thinks they aren't in the right headspace or doesn't think they know what they want enough, he MAY not do it. And with good reason, I guess. That said, he mentioned he does not send people away for psychiatric evaluation. Others do, he said he does not.

- Newcastle - Dr Brett Locker huntergyanaecology.com.au . Dr Locker has a room at Suite 6, Level 1 3 Hoptoun Street, Charlestown, NSW, 2290 but I got a referral from another doctor to see him at John Hunter Hospital. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me (26F). He consults in Newcastle but performed the procedure at Singleton.

-1 Dr Locker, So I went in to see him when I was 26 years old. I brought my binder and everything, but he laughed at it, and said I'd have a tough time finding someone to sterilise a 26 year old and that I'd have to take him to court over it, because of me being on the autism spectrum too. He happily gave me an IUD though, which I begrudgingly accepted. Am still looking to get a bisalp a couple years later.

**South Australia**

- Adelaide -  Vasectomy: I'd like to recommend the redgum clinic but with Dr Scott Marschall who I had my consult with as he was very open minded about performing it, despite me being 18. As of today, the 22nd of June, the procedure was completed and it seems to be completely fine, no major pains

- Adelaide - Bilateral Salpingectomy/Tubal ligation: [Dr Paul Knight](https://www.agsc.com.au/paul-knight-adelaide.html), may need a 2nd gynecologist to sign off on procedure for under 27yo but has provided salpingectomy for childfree women. 

- Adelaide - [Dr Charlotte Paull](https://www.glowspecialists.com.au/dr-charlotte-paull). She is a gynaecologist who works at Noarlunga Hospital, a public hospital. I was scheduled to have my tubal ligation done there and she was one of the gynaecologists who signed off on it (The hospital requires 2 to sign off before patient can be admitted). She did mention IUD but that seems par for the course when discussing this procedure. I was unable to have the procedure due to moving interstate and dealing with state borders and Covid issues, so she offered to send through a referral to a NSW gynaecologist. The procedure would have cost me nothing as it’s all covered by the public system. About Me: I was 28yo & engaged to my future husband when the surgery was approved, and I’m CF

- Adelaide - [Dr Charlotte Jones](https://ohalloranmedical.com.au/staff) She is the GP who referred me to Noarlunga Hospital to speak to Dr Paull. She was slightly hesitant initially and discussed IUD with me first, but after explaining the adverse effects of the implant & the impact pregnancy would have on my mental health (I have bipolar 2), she then supported me and referred me. The appointment was roughly $30 after Medicare rebate. About Me: I was 28yo & engaged to my future husband when the surgery was approved, and I’m CF

- Blackwood - Dr Aziza Mirzaeva, referred for tubal ligation with no pushback. 

- Whyalla - Tubal Ligation: [Dr David MacFarlane](https://www.healthshare.com.au/profile/professional/134096-dr-david-macfarlane/#overview) (OBGYN) at Whyalla Hospital. Absolutely fantastic guy. I (29F) went to him looking for a tubal ligation, was very supportive and said he'd be more than happy to do it for me, and would have done it even if I was 20. Only reason he eventually decided to not do mine was because I have complex medical issues and a history of an abdominal wall infection which prevents the laprascopic surgery from being done safely, but was happy to give me a Mirena instead, and seemed sympathetic to my plight of not being able to have the tubal. He would probably do a tubal on a healthy young woman. I'm pretty sure he only practices through the public hospital.

**Australian Capital Territory** 

Dr Sarah Broderick, bilateral salpingectomy 34yo 

**Tasmania**

- Launceston - Dr Toly Pavlov - Launceston Health Hub - (03) 6388 8115. Toly is an amazing gynae, he didn't even ask me if I was sure, because he could tell by my referrals and other letters that I was absolutely sure. He said instead that I fully support you! He practices at the LGH for sterilisations and therefore his waiting list is very long, around two or three years. However I do believe medicare will cover you for surgery in the LGH. He was more than happy to do my (20) Bisalp and had no problem with my age. He said his youngest sterilisation was 18, and that he would do someone who is 18 again.

- Launceston - Dr Ben Dhanaraj - Ashton Gate House - (03) 6343 0999 https://tamarobgyn.com.au/dr-ben-dhanaraj Ben is a very nice doctor, however he takes a little bit of convincing and likes a letter from a psychologist. After the initial bit of hesitiation he is pretty open to sterilisation. He wanted me (20) to get a second opinion from another gynae in the area, that turned out to be a bit hard as many are quite booked up. He also recommended Dr Toly Pavlov for a second opinion. His waiting list is also quite large as he also operates at the LGH for sterilisation. 

- Hobart - Dr Sajid Patel - Fertility Tasmania 03 6169 1111 https://fertilitytasmania.com.au/about/team/ Don't be scared off because he practices in an IVF clinic!!! The reception team are amazing and Sajid is the best gynae I have ever seen. I was referred to him by Dr Toly Pavlov because Toly's wait list was too long and Toly didn't want me to wait. He practices at the Hobart Private Hospital and I only had to wait 14 days between the initial consultation with him and the Bisalp. He asked if I was really sure and I said I was, he then (jokingly) said if I change my mind he can help me with IVF. We talked through options like clips or complete removal, and which he can reverse ect. Give him a shout out that you found him on reddit for extra bonus points ;)

- +1 Dr Saj Patel (wasnt the surgeon, but did give approval). I think it's worth putting under his information that it's useless to go through the RHH to get any sterilization done, you have to pay to see him privately $205AUD. He can then transfer you across to the RHH to get the procedure free, but you can not see him directly through the RHH no matter how hard you push for it. I got a Bi-salp and attempted Ablation (failed) within 3 months of approval, second Ablation (successful) literally 7 days after I finally got another appointment 3 months later (was a battle to get seen). All up 12 month battle to get approval and then 6 months to get everything done.

###New Zealand

- Across the whole country - [Snip](https://snip.co.nz). Very quick and easy, only needed to send an email stating understanding of the consequences, price is $425 NZD with a 10% refund if you review them on Google. "Our general policy is that anyone under 30 years of age with no children would not be considered for a vasectomy procedure".

 - +1 Snip - 30, married, no children - these questions were asked on the Snip Clinic website's questionnaire but never challenged, they just sent me an appointment time in response. Their FAQs say there's no minimum age or parental status requirement. Price of the Vasectomy was $550 + $50 for an optional home sperm test for the 3 month check. Zero bingos, just support and a great experience.

- Invercargill - Danielle Jones, MD - Obs & Gynae in New Zealand. This gynecologist has contacted us directlyto advise, "happy to provide desired sterilization regardless of any of those factors. I am public only, so can be difficult to get in with our current shortages and I unfortunately don't have a lot of control. They are welcome to ask their GP to email me directly and I will always do my best to help. I will have to ask around if others feel the same as I do."

- North Island - Dr Mairi Wallace at the Cardinal Points Specialist Centre. 8 Percy Street, Kensington, Whangarei 0112 , North Island, New Zealand Phone number +64 9 437 4091. Dr Mairi is a most amazing human being, they listened and did not judge. I cried with happiness after meeting with them for first time.

- Wellington - Dr Andrew Murray http://hospitals.southerncross.co.nz/our-hospitals/wellington/medical-specialists.aspx?Surgeonid=76
Fairly quick and easy after a recommendation from Family Planning doctor (can't remember her name, but was a lovely Indian woman who wrote a good letter of recommendation for me).

- Wellington - [Dr Shane Dunphy](https://www.wellingtonvasectomyclinic.co.nz/) "Shane questioned me a bit at the start, but was happy to perform the procedure once he saw that I was steadfast in my decision to get a vasectomy. He had no issues with my age (21M). The procedure was quick, simple and painless, with minimal discomfort afterwards. Highly recommended to all."

- Wellington - [Dr. Simon McDowell](https://acesohealth.co.nz/about-us/dr-simon-mcdowell/) 21F, CF, unmarried. He performed my much-needed hysterectomy last year. He can be seen through three different clinics, I saw him at Wellington hospital's gyno clinic via the NZ public system. I think that Dr. McDowell only sees patients with either severe menstrual problems or fertility issues, but that makes him an absolute life-saver for anyone suffering gyno problems that can't be solved without sterilization. He was the first doctor to ever prioritize my quality of life over my fertility, and he never bingoed me. Dr. McDowell did have me talk to his colleague Dr. Searle in order to insure that I was giving informed consent for my hysto, but I didn't get any bingoing from him either! The surgery was also covered by public healthcare.

- Christchurch - Dr Ruth MacAskill at the Campus Health Centre at the University of Canterbury.  https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/healthcentre/
After seeing my lack of success on birth controls, was happy to write me a letter of recommendation once I chose my surgeon. My age (26F) might have helped, but she only offered the option of referral for Mirena, she didn't push it. I ended up choosing a Bilateral Salpingectomy. If you are a poor student you may be eligible for referral to the Charity Hospital for both options too.

- Christchurch - Dr Colin Conaghan (surgeon) http://www.coga.org.nz/
Initial consultation was $255 (Sept. 2018), but he was very open and didn't press about reasons or my age (26F), accepting that my doctor had made a sound judgement. Showed me the difference between the clips and bilateral salpingectomy. Let me choose. Simply said "if I wasn't sure I wouldn't be here, can I please get the Salpingectomy." Asked when I wanted to be booked in, appointment 7 days later. Option to be paid through either medical insurance, or full-pay ($8,000-$10,000).

- Christchurch - Dr Simon Jones (surgeon) at Oxford Women's Health https://www.oxfordwomenshealth.co.nz/about-us/our-team/womens-health/team-member-4.html
Very quick consultation, didn't question me for my age (24F) or bingo me, and trusted my GP's counsel and referral. I got my consult through the Canterbury Charity Hospital (unfortunately I don't think you can request specific surgeons) but if you aren't eligible Simon is a specialist at Oxford Women's health

- Auckland - [Dr Phill McChesney, FRANZCOG] (https://www.fertilityassociates.co.nz/team-members/dr-phill-mcchesney/) 7 Ellerslie Racecourse Dr., Remuera, Auckland, 1051, New Zealand  09-520-9520, 0800 10 28 28, faa@fa.co.nz. Private pay only. Accepts Southern Cross Health Insurance. Following a referral from my GP and a consult with another gynaecologist, he accepted me (24F, nulligravida) for a bilateral tubal ligation with filshie clips. He noted if I hadn't have seen another gyno previously, he would have asked me to go to one session with their on site counsellors to be sure, however was still very willing. I did want a salpingectomy, however tubal ligation was offered instead due to my age. Despite this, Phill has an amazing bedside manner, happy to answer any questions and didn't bingo me at all. Completely agreed that if I'm old enough to have kids, I'm old enough to choose not to have them too so booked me in for surgery a month after the consult.

Note re Dr McChesney: 28F - Requested Bilateral Salpingectomy (BiSalp) specifically for sterilisation purposes. Dr Phill said his preferred method is using clips as there is a small chance of reversing the procedure vs no chance with BiSalp. But BiSalp also has many other advantages over the clips in terms of effectiveness and reduction in chance of cancer. He was willing to do the BiSalp for me as I strongly preferred it over clips due to effectiveness. He also mentioned IVF is possible after BiSalp as another reason he was willing to do a BiSalp for me. He did ask why not other options, and was understanding of my reasons and took me seriously. He did say he would not deny me fertility treatment based on my age so therefore did not think it right deny me sterilisation based on my age. I found him to be willing to listen and respectful. He did do an internal ultrasound at the consult just to check everything looked ok as I had not had one before. I had my BiSalp 6 weeks later - usually wait time is about 4 weeks. This procedure was fully covered by Southern Cross Ultracare plan after being on the plan for one year.

- Auckland - [Dr. Sunil Pillay, MRCOG, FRANZCOG] (https://www.fertilityassociates.co.nz/team-members/dr-sunil-pillay/) 7 Ellerslie Racecourse Dr., Remuera, Auckland, 1051, New Zealand  09-520-9520, 0800 10 28 28, faa@fa.co.nz. Sterilised 28 year old CF nonbinary AFAB. Private pay only, paid for by Southern Cross Health Insurance. You have to be on the UltraCare Plan which is around $130NZD ($81USD) per month). They will also cover all appointments that are to do with this procedure so I have paid $0.00. After 12 months I booked in with a surgeon for a consult and this was covered by the insurance, which is otherwise in excess of $NZ200. I had to get a letter of approval from my GP that I had discussed other methods of birth control, approval from a second gynecologist and a letter from my therapist that I was sure and of 'sound mind' blah blah. He has really looked after me and I really feel respected and that my wants are valid. Physician also correctly diagnosed endometriosis that patient had not realized she had. That was also treated as part of the sterilization. 

- Auckland - Dr. Jonathan Masters [The Vasman](https://www.vasman.co.nz/), Auckland, New Zealand. I had a good experience getting a vasectomy from Dr. Jonathan Masters (The Vasman). I was 25, married and childfree. All it took was one phone call to schedule an appointment, and an hour in the office for paperwork and the vasectomy. He had no hesitations or bingos. Cost ~NZD500.

- Nelson - [Andy Malcom](https://www.andymalcolmurology.com/ Urologist).  Performed vasectomy. 33/m married. Referred to following an unsuccessful procedure with a general practitioner, due to other medical reasons.(Graham Loveridge - http://www.harleymedical.co.nz/about-us/our-doctors/dr-graham-loveridge/ who was also willing to do the vasectomy, but unable to complete it). Very supportive of cf status. He asked how many kids I had, after agreeing to the procedure, I said none and his exact words were "none and done! Good way to go!" Nz$600, which is a bit more expensive than most in NZ. Very quick and easy. Will probably need a referral from a General Practitioner to see him.

Abbotsford:  Dr Clayron Tuffnell - Abbotsford, BC 2190 W Railway St #202, Abbotsford, BC V2S 2E2 (604) 859-7725. Incredible doctor. Very open and clear with communication, non-judgemental, helpful, supportive, and encouraging. He saw me through all my menstrual issues, performed a laparoscopic search in my early 20s unfortunately to no avail and I put it on the back burner for a few years. When I went back to him as things got worse again, he informed me of my options and I chose a hysterectomy, which he was very supportive and encouraging of. No "what if you want kids later" no "what if you meet someone," just "as long as you understand that it's irreversible" and that was that. No judgement, no pressure, just support. Performed my hysterectomy just after my 30th birthday Nov 2020. Just before going under I started to have a panic attack and he held my hand as I tearfull calmed down until I was under. It went great, found out the reason for my issues, and it improved my life immensely. Went in for the follow up and everything looked good. Massive thank you to Dr Tuffnell and his team. See you in 4/5 years for a cervix-less pap!

Burnaby: Dr. Jennifer Muir. I got my bi-salp on January 20th, 2022. https://affinitywomenshealth.com. She did not bingo me (25F) was very respectful of my choice. She listed the physical and emotional side effects briefly, then asked how soon I’d like to schedule. As I am Canadian, this surgery was free. She is professional and to the point.

Comox Valley: [Dr. Matthew Bagdan at Oceanview women's clinic](http://oceanviewwomensclinic.ca/). I go in on Thursday September 9th. I just went to Dr. Bagdan 6 months ago and said I was done with periods. I have one small fibroid. He easily agreed, without judgement or any questions, to a full hysterectomy. I'm a single, childless, 37 year old woman.

-1 Dr Bagdan, I contacted him to get my tubes removed, he made me wait months, wasted my time, never referred me to someone else like he said he would, said I'd regret it and was overall rude. 

+1 Dr Bagdan I am 28 and have severe endometriosis that is mostly managed by medication, but not entirely. I have no interest in fertility. I asked for surgery (either a laporascopy or hysterectomy, whatever to get the rogue tissue out of my abdomen), and he said he would do it, but only once I turned 35 as hysterectomies too young is shown to cause heart disease, and a lap wouldn't be worth the surgery for the benefit. If the meds go horribly wrong, he'd do it at 30.

Duncan - Dr. Drew M Phillips - actually a resident under Dr. William Nielson. Had the appointment with just Dr. Phillips but my primary doctor referred me to Dr. Nielson, so I guess Dr. Phillips gets some of his patients. Address is 3106 Gibbins Rd, Duncan, British Columbia V9L 1E8 Canada. (250) 746-7711. Vasectomy - actually it is scheduled for April but just got the thumbs up from him to do the procedure yesterday, so I figured I'd help some folks out and post this now. 26, Unmarried, completely childfree. Asked me if I was in a relationship and if my partner didn't want children. Answered yes. Also told him I have been thinking about a vasectomy for 10 years and would rather adopt than have children. That was all the questioning, he was very supportive.

Nanaimo: Dr. P.J. Mitchell.  Prefers to do a Bilateral salpingectomy (removes both fallopian tubes) but gives you the option. Willing to sterilize 21 year old women, very easy to talk to, non-judgmental.  Normal referral and surgical wait times apply. MSP covered. 

Nanaimo: Dr Jeffrey Somerville, MD, Nanaimo Regional General Hospital, British Columbia. Bisalp on 30-year-old CF redditor, along with emergency surgical removal of IUD. Dr Somerville discussed my choice of permanent birth control via bilateral salpingectomy, without judgement or arguments. Referred by Lexitor clinic staff physician. You must have a referral to see this surgeon.

Nanaimo: [Dr. Regina Renner](https://www.yellowpages.ca/bus/British-Columbia/Nanaimo/Renner-Regina-Dr/8219341.html
) (currently on leave, involved in consultation) and Dr. Julia Parkman (performed surgery and consultation) at 501-1515 Dufferin Cres, Nanaimo, BC, V9S 5H6. The phone number is (778)-441-1993, HOWEVER, in my region at least I think you need to be referred to an OB/GYN in most cases (I could be wrong about this). Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy (April 2023). 25 (24 when I was approved), unmarried, 0 children. The hardest part was getting an appointment with Dr. Renner/Dr. Parkman—my regular physician refered me and it took over a year to finally secure a consultation. Both doctors assured me that they believed in my ability and my right to decide what was best for my reproductive health, and were happy to schedule the bisalp as long as I understood that sterilization is permanent, and that I was familiar with all other birth control options available to me. The procedure went off without a hitch, and recovery has been a breeze thus far. Dr. Parkman took the time to go over the procedure with me and respond to any questions or concerns I had prior to going under. She made me feel at ease, and I'm happy I put my trust in her. Also, their receptionist, Wanda, is an absolute gem. 10/10 experience.

New Westminster: Dr Nakatsuka Nao (referral required from general practitioner/family doctor) 302-223 Nelson's Cres, New Westminster, BC V3L 0E4 604-522-8272. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy. 26F, never had children, and am in a common-law relationship. I did not experience any bingos. She was upfront that she required two appointments to get to know my situation better before being comfortable with sterilization. She explained the pros/cons of my various options, and asked me to explain my reasons for being childfree. On the second appointment, she agreed to hysterectomy and bisalp with no pushback.

[Dr. Shilpa Dabholkar (referral)](https://www.gainmedicalcentre.com/contact-us) At 24 I saw her to get a referral for a gynecologist with the goal of getting a hysterectomy. We discussed my reasons for being childfree, and for wanting a hysterectomy as opposed to other methods of sterilization. After that discussion she referred me for hysterectomy with no bingos or pushback.

Penticton: Dr. Kevin Renaud. +1 250-460-3010. I was 26 at the time with no children and am unmarried. He listened to me, gave me the info to make an informed decision and didn’t give any push back when I made my choice. 10/10 would recommend.

Attended the Penticton Urgent and Primary Care Centre for a referral, Aug-17-2022. Received call early October with appointment date. Attended appointment Nov-28-2022, explained that I was seeking sterilization, Dr. Ryckman explained procedure, risks and ensured I knew this was a permanent procedure and told me she was happy to go ahead. I experienced no push back, no “interrogation” just asked if I understood the permanence and that if I ever decided that I wanted children it would need to be via IVF at my own cost. Received call mid December with surgery date of Feb-03-2023. Had surgery at Penticton Hospital yesterday, overall I was in the hospital for around 4 hours, all staff were kind and caring with no questions asked regarding my choice to be sterilized.


Prince George: Dr Robin Johnson of the Blossom Fertility And Medical clinic in Prince George, British Columbia https://blossomfertility.ca/. I’m a 36f, unmarried, childfree. I was referred to her via the walk-in clinic. I only had a fifteen minute zoom appointment with her, during which she approved me for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy and put me on the waiting list right away. I didn’t feel any disapproval from her, though she did mention age as a possible factor but that, and all her questions, felt more like a check-list she was required to go through. She was a bit curt, but not at all rude. All and all a good experience and she was a great surgeon.

Richmond: [Dr Don Wilson.](https://www.cpsbc.ca/public/registrant-directory/search-result/330041/Wilson%2CDonald) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heiltsuk_paleo/status/1478951745787097091?s=20&t=8Lm7ZeOj940t7p15aCPYGQ). Provided bilateral salpingectomy to a 26-year-old CF woman, no spousal consent required. Time from referral to consult was approx. 1 year, time from consult to operation was 1 month. Very professional, staff was very enthusiastic; direct quote: "You're a grown woman, you're able to make your own decisions, who am I to say no?" 

+1 Dr Wilson - has also sterilised 30F. 

+1 Dr Wilson - 29 F bilateral salpingectomy. I brought my binder and husband with me to the consultation just in case. I didn’t need it. He believed it was my body, and I didn’t need my husband’s approval. Booked in within 3 months and it was a success with no complications. Said recent studies show it could prevent some ovarian cancers that originate in the fallopian tubes.

Vancouver: [Dr. Gregory Mallek](https://www.seamar.org/clark-medical-vancouver-womens-health-clinic.html) at Vancouver Women's Health Clinic - Bilateral salpingectomy. 35, single, zero children. Performed 2 months after consultation. Dr. Mallek was very respectful and did not question my decision at all. I asked for his permission and he is happy to be added to this list. Open to sterilising 21+ if the patient is absolutely sure they don't ever want children.

Vancouver: [Dr Evelyn Dunn](https://affinitywomenshealth.com), Affinity Women’s Health 3809 Sunset Street Burnaby, British Columbia (Canada) V5G 1T4 Phone: 1-604-565-9447. Bilateral Salpingectomy 29F. Approval in February, original surgery date June, actual surgery date August. Clinic is busy but Dr Dunn’s receptionist Jessica Singh has poor communication and lost me two appointment times that I’d had booked before eventually securing a date. Dunn herself is great, terse and upfront but not unfriendly. She did suggest IUD to start at the consultation but I was firm about bisalp so after ensuring I was absolutely certain, she had me sign the legal paperwork right there. Closest I got to a bingo was her asking why my bf wasn’t getting a vasectomy instead due to it being easier but respected that I didn’t want to rely on him. Great treatment, very comfortable at every stage.

Vancouver: [Dr. Michelle Bélanger at Cross Roads Obstetrics and Gynaecology](ink: https://www.crossroadsobgyn.ca/dr-belanger). Bilateral Salpingectomy 34, single, no kids. Surgery date set after one phone consultation. No bingo other than wanting to make sure that I know this is permanent/irreversible. The clinic is slow in following up, 6 months passed from referral to consultation call with multiple contact attempts on my end, surgery 2 months after consultation at BC Women’s - great staff there. Dr. Bélanger is not warm and fuzzy but matter-of-fact, which I appreciated. Costs covered by MSP for Canadian Permanent Resident.

Vancouver: GP Dr. Bahar Ghobassy provided the referral and the vasectomy was performed by Dr. Ted Hoyda.

Made me write a brief letter for legal reasons saying I understood it was permanent and non-reversible and that I would not hold him responsible if I changed my mind. *Update Oct. 24, 2017* Doctor is no longer practicing in Kelowna, unsure where he's moved to.

Edmonton: [Dr. Amanda Kim](https://www.healthdoc.ca/listing/dr-amanda-kim-gynecologist-obgyn-edmonton-ab) Capital City Women’s Centre 17010 90 Ave NW #196, Edmonton, Alberta Canada T5T 1L6, 780-439-2007.

Went on list in May, got call to schedule surgery early October for end of October.

Calgary: [Intramed Medical Centre](https://intramed.ca/vasectomy/) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I had a no-scalpel, open-ended vasectomy completed there today. I am a childfree 36 year old male. No kids at all. Married. They only mention the typical disclaimer at the beginning about it being permanent, and that you have the option to store sperm and can consider it prior to going through with the procedure, but in no way was a BINGO dropped. There were even some fun comments during the procedure about the "good life" of me choosing not to have kids. Surgeons were Dr. Phillip van der Merwe and Dr. Crouse.

Calgary: Dr. Kristensen at Richmond Medical centre in Calgary, AB, Canada. Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24yo.

Calgary: OBGYN Dr. Bruce Allen (Southcentre executive tower, referral required).

Calgary: [Dr. Mattatall](http://www.chrysalis-obgyn.ca/) approved a bilateral salpingectomy on a 21 year old, female. Single, no children for simply not wanting kids.

She said she would refer me for the procedure because it was my choice. She's also a capable GP and I enjoy having her as my doctor.

Lethbridge/Rural Southern Alberta: Dr. Codruta Abhilash (GP) Campbell Clinic Coaldale
Referred 23 year old to a small surgery doctor. Consultation required, but no resistance. 

Lethbridge: Dr. Adedayo Aladegbaiye (Dr. Dayo) Very friendly, offered thorough consultation on my birth control options and happily provided me with an IUD.

Lethbridge: Dr. Allyson Adolph (OB/GYN). Was referred by Dr. Johann Meyer (GP - Campbell Clinic Coaldale). Busy, but friendly, and good bedside manner. I was in my early 30s when I met with her. She did not express any judgment or resistance. Just established I did not want children and wanted a permanent birth control option and gave me an enthusiastic "so, ready to do this then?". Referral to consult was 2-3 months and first appointment had to be rescheduled after I had already arrived at her office as she was called out, but met with her a couple weeks later at Chinook Regional, and time from consult to surgery for bilateral salpingectomy was one month (and that was in part due to my own schedule). 

Lethbridge: [Dr. Andrea Haner](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Andrea-Haner/-1443524563), in Lethbridge Alberta. Referred 31yo female for tubal ligation, no questions asked and no attempts to refuse or tries to convince of other options.

Red Deer:  [Dr. Christopher Cham]( https://www.drchamreddeer.com/). I'm a 31yr old single woman, obviously childfree. I was referred to Dr. Cham at a walk-in clinic in June, and my surgery was booked for mid-August. From start to finish, I didn't hear a single BINGO from anyone on his team, and felt very informed and respected the whole way. It's been almost five months now and I haven't had a single complication or concern. Some of his reviews mention he isn't "friendly", but I didn't find that to be the case; he was perfectly friendly, he just didn't bother with extra chit-chat, which I personally appreciate and prefer! I highly recommend any woman seeking sterilization to consider Dr. Cham for their procedure!

####Saskatchewan

Regina: Dr. H. Kamencic - Shares an office with Dr. J Thiel at 2631 28 Ave, Regina, SK S4S 6X3
Obtained e-recommendation (on request for Tubal Ligation) from GP, and Dr. Kamencic was the one who returned my call. Wanted to ensure I had looked at all options before Tubal. Confirmed my steadfast decision and he booked the surgery. Little resistance if you are set in your decision.

[Dr John Thiel](https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/obstetrics-and-gynecology/Thiel-John.php#About). I just had an incredible sterilization consult with a doctor in Regina. He listened to me, did not question my choice on sterilization whatsoever, and got me on the waitlist for a hysterectomy(!) with no battle whatsoever. I'm 26 years old, and went in to the appt sure that I was going to get laughed out or have to settle for a bisalp despite that not really being what I wanted. Instead HE suggested a hysterectomy would suit my needs more. And, once again, I didn't even have to establish reasoning for not wanting children, didn't talk about it whatsoever, he just came in knowing that's what I wanted and didn't press at. all. Just an absolute breath of fresh air.

Saskatoon: Dr. Natasha Payton OBGYN - 149 Pacific Ave. She is super friendly, listened to my concerns and explanations for why I wanted a tubal ligation and helped me book the procedure without hesitation. I'm 25, never given birth. Very easy to talk to!

Dr. Marissa Topping at [Yeboah E K & Schubert Matt & Stewart Sabrina Drs (306) 652-4331 140 Wall St, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7K 1N4](https://g.co/kgs/k2j2rC). Originally went for a different issue and during my follow up appointment I asked about sterilization. She confirmed that I was 100% positive and booked another appointment to sign paperwork in February. My surgery was on May 25th. The reception staff here isn’t fantastic and failed to let me know my surgery had been moved to a different time that day, so I waited in the hospital for 7 hours. But she didn’t fight me about sterilization or bingo me beforehand, and removed my iud, both fallopian tubes and a cyst found during the procedure, which was free of cost.

Barrie: [Dr. Fefelova](https://drfefelova.ca/), who approved me for the surgery as well as performed it. I had one initial consultation with her in which I explained that all forms of birth control I've tried have made me sick and since I don't want to have kids anyway I would rather get a tubal ligation than keep harming myself with various forms of birth control. She didn't doubt my wishes and scheduled the surgery for about a month after that consultation. I should also mention that this consultation was the first and only time we had met.

Belleville: Dr. Paul Kovacs OBGYN - Was more than willing to offer me a tubal ligation at age 25 when I informed him I don't want children ever. His bedside manner is pleasant but very to the point, he does not sugarcoat things he just tells it like it is and answers your questions. Had surgery done by him was very simple and easy no issues. There was a two month wait for an appointment. The office is busy but the most I ever waited was about an hour.

Belleville: [Dr. Julie Ellsworth](https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/Ellsworth-Julie-Caroline/0288496-100635). Bilateral salpingectomy. 35 My marital status: Single, never married Childfree all the way! No bingos during consultation. Went in for tubal ligation originally & the doctor actually recommended the bisalp instead. Listed reduction of cancer risk as a major benefit. Great bedside manner, quick surgery. Wait time for consultation was about 10 months, but then surgery was scheduled less than a month after consultation.

Brantford: Dr. Anne Powell OBGYN- Agreed to do a tubal ligation (Filshie clips) at age 27.  Very easy to talk to and non-judgmental, listened to every word I said and took me seriously.  2 months wait time for consult scheduled December 11th, pre-op scheduled for February 8th, surgery scheduled for March 3rd.  

Burlington: Dr. Christopher B. Allard, Urologist - Vasectomy on 31M. Easy to talk to. Mildly surprised when "no kids" was mentioned but just confirmed we knew it was permanent and was totally respectful. Totally covered by OHIP. From consult to surgery was 3 months as he only does surgeries Mondays. Note: he did a traditional scalpel vasectomy. Although it went well, I recommend going to Toronto for a non-scalpel procedure for ease of healing.

Burlington: Dr. Anoop Nayar, GP - Referral for vasectomy on 31M (referred to Dr. Allard). Also very respectful. Asked if there was a reason why but followed it up with assurance that he respected patient's choice. From GP to Urologist appointment was 3 months. Note: He thought everybody does non-scalpel vasecomties, but referred us to a urologist who only did traditional scalpel procedures (Dr. Allard).

Grimsby: [Dr. Andrea Mosher](https://www.hamiltonhealthsciences.ca/share/wlmh-welcomes-dr-mosher/). West Lincoln Memorial Hospital 169 Main Street East, Grimsby, Ontario, Canada. L3M 1P3. 1 (905) 945-5757 (# for her office, not the hospital). I am 31, single, no kids. I did not get bingo’d or any sort of pushback. Dr. Mosher was wonderful in all aspects. I received a call that I was being referred to her on Nov 1 2021, and was scheduled for surgery end of January. (Ended up in April due to COVID lockdown but still very quick from initial appointment to surgery). She performed a bilateral salpingectomy. Dr Mosher also told me she has done the procedure on women much younger than me. She was taught under Dr Caroline Sibley who is on the CF list and highly recommended.

Guelph: [Dr. Wesley-James, Urologist](https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/T-WesleyJames/0040587-54563) Great doctor who's done 10,000 vasectomies. Didn't question my decision despite my young age (20s).

GTA: Dr. Darren Sukerman -Family / G.P. Etobicoke, Ontario 

GTA: [Canadian Men's Clinic - Dr. Blumenfeld & Dr. Hirshberg](http://www.mensclinic.com/) - 416-636-7377 - Provided a vasectomy to me at age 25 with no children. Absolutely no attempts to change my mind, absolutely no reluctance. A simple confirmation of "This procedure is permanent, are you sure?" is all I got. Extremely friendly &amp; non-judgemental. It is a men's sexual health clinic, mostly operating after hours and weekends. I had Dr. Blumenfeld, he is a kidney transplant surgeon by day, and operates this men's clinic by night. He is professional, skilled, and friendly. He told me that he has performed thousands of no-scalpel vasectomies. The procedure was quick, and mostly painless, and the doc was even making jokes throughout. I had a quick phone consultation, and the procedure was booked for 2 weeks after. This place should be your first choice if you are in Ontario.

Adding a recommendation for Canadian Men's Clinic, I got my vasectomy here 2 years ago, highly recommended. Totally agree with everything in the above paragraph.

NB Canadian Men's Clinic refused vasectomy for an 18yo patient so may have age limits. 

GTA: Gentle Procedures Mississauga - Dr. Sing - Provided a vasectomy to me at age 29 with no children. Stated they prefer patient be 25+. No resistance, non-judgmental, incredibly friendly reception and procedure. Dr Sing was patient for any questions or concerns. Seemed to appreciate that I had done research on the procedure before hand and had made appropriate arrangements for comfort and health. Procedure is 100% covered by OHIP, zero out of pocket cost, highly recommended. - https://www.gentleprocedureswestgta.ca/

Hamilton: [Dr. Caroline Sibley OBGYN](https://plus.google.com/107418114340110181118/about?gl=ca&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en) Essure procedure (hard to find docs who do this in ON) or tubal ligation, your choice. Also an overall great doctor. Very respectful during consultation, took my word for it that I was sure of my decision without prodding or condescension. Wait list for consult was several months long. However, from consult to surgery was 3 weeks.

Already saw her as a gynecologist, and booked an appointment to discuss sterilization. She laid out the three options - Essure, tubal ligation, or bilateral salpingectomy - and asked which one I would like. Settled on the bilateral salpingectomy due to metal sensitivity. No bingos, condescension, or questioning. Time from appointment to surgery was about a month, and Dr. Sibley is the one to perform the surgery. 

Hamilton: [Dr. Dustin Costescu, MD, MS, FRCSC]( https://costescu.ca/) McMaster University Medical Centre 1200 Main St West 2F Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic. Dr. Costescu’s clinical practice focuses in contraceptive care, family planning, colposcopy, and sexual medicine.Has online availability calendar. Performed tubal ligation with clips on 22-year-old woman. Called his assistant at McMaster to get a fax number, which I gave to my family doctor and asked for a referral. Was initially going to have to wait months for a consult but his office called the second an earlier appointment opened up. Surgery three months later. Not only did an excellent job with the surgery, but could not have been more respectful and honest during the consultation process. One of the best doctors I've had in any capacity. Very knowledgeable about birth control in general if you have questions or are considering other options. Sex-positive, trans- and non-binary friendly, LGBTQ+ friendly, body-positive. Respectful of First Nations peoples. 

+1 Arranged and approved bisalp on 21F, August 2022.

Hamilton: Dr. Marc Anthony Fischer-Booked for a vasectomy on a 39 year old single man with no kids. No bingo's, no judgement when I said I don't want kids ever and even joked that kids can really mess up your life.  1 Young St., Suite 419. 

Hamilton: [Dr. Mathew Leonardi](www.mathewleonardi.com), MD, PhD, FRCSC, endometriosis excision expert. Willing to perform a laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy on 22 year old AFAB with endometriosis and PCOS. Stated that he is always happy to perform such procedures upon request.

Kingston: [Dr Ashley Waddington](https://obgyn.queensu.ca/faculty/ashley-waddington) performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 25 year old. 

London: Dr. Cynthia Chan, works out of the Womens Healthcare Center in Victoria Hospital. She was very friendly and supportive, I went in for a pre-abortion appointment and she asked if I was interested in an IUD, I responded that I actually really wanted a permanent solution she simply said "we can definitely talk about that" and we booked a consult for after my procedure. Approved my BiSalp at 22 years old (no children), wanted to have me wait a year to be confident but we agreed on six months. Surgery was delayed by COVID, but I was approved in February and surgery was completed in October. I did not need a referral since I went in for other reasons, I believe you can simply call the center to discuss a consult, otherwise the internet says she does take referrals.

London: Dr. Michael Anthony Maruncic - Gynaecologist/OBGYN - Works out of Victoria Hospital. Took 7 months to get a referral appointment for consultation. He was informative and no nonsense. Didn't ask about my relationship status, just wanted to make sure I was sure and went over other options but was happy to do what I wanted in the end. Doing my tubal at age 25 in October, 3 months from consult appointment to surgery date. 

London: Dr. Josef Vladars - MD - He is located at 130 Thompson Rd and I believe he closed his FMD practice to exclusively perform vasectomies.  My husband (at age 32) and another childfree couple we know both had their vasectomies there.  The referral time between our FMD and seeing Dr. Vladars was a few months, then the first consult and the actual surgery were three weeks apart.  The process was simple once referred (no huge hassle about not already having children), and my husband was in and out under an hour.  A very professional and quick clinic.

London: Dr. Marius Cristian Naghiu - Asked me (22m - no children) no questions about my decision to have a vasectomy and gave me a referral on the first visit. 

London: [Dr. Robert Di Cecco](https://www.southwesthealthline.ca/displayservice.aspx?id=168097), "Dr.Di Cecco did a bilateral salphectomy on me in 2018 when I was 27 (no kids no pregnancies). He did ask about if I became involved with someone who wanted kids but was satisfied with the answer "he wouldn't be my husband if he wanted kids". He explained the non permanent options and was the one that suggested tube removal instead of clipping because it reduces ovarian cancer risks and female cancers run in the family. I had my referral in oct 2017 and walked out of there in about 10 minutes with a " before Christmas or after" for an appointment. He does have a sense of humor not everyone would like but I enjoyed it and since he is also a OB sometimes clinics run late if there are delivery issues. 

London: [Dr. Deborah Peneva](https://www.southwesthealthline.ca/displayservice.aspx?id=168157) Everything went super smoothly with absolutely no pushback and the surgery went great. My family doctor sent a referral and after my initial consultation, my surgery was scheduled for about 6 months later.

Newmarket: Dr. Matthew Laskin. No website, but address is 679 Davis Dr Unit 100, Newmarket, ON L3Y 2R2, performed my bilateral salpingectomy. I was 30 when approved for procedure, 31 when it actually happened. Their office booked me quickly for an OR date, but covid had me waiting months and months for an open date. (nonessential surgeries were rescheduled multiple times in Ontario) Zero bingos, amazing bedside manner. Thorough, explained every risk and option available to ensure I made an informed decision. Very trustworthy. Kind office staff.

St Cathrines: Dr Katrina Zefkic, bilateral salpingectomy for 27yo. "She said I have the right not to have children and she has no problems doing it if that's what I want". 

Thunder Bay: Ontario Cascade Clinic - 63 N Algoma St, Suite 410 P7A 4Z6, 807-699-0692 Dr's Jumah and Power Bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 28, common law, firmly child free. You must have a referral to access the clinic, this can be from a walk in clinic. Wait times are about 4 to 6 months for the first consult. The clinic policy is they require a second opinion for all elective procedures, but that this second opinion can be from the other doctor in the clinic. Dr Jumah discussed the options for a bilateral salpingectomy or tubal ligation, and spoke to the pros/cons for each procedure. No bingos, she just discussed the permanence of the procedure and that all surgery has risks. The procedure is covered under the provincial health system for residents of Ontario. I personally know two other cf women who also had positive experiences with this clinic and with Dr Jumah.

Toronto: [Dr Melanie Ornstein](https://www.openarmsobgyn.ca/), located in Toronto, Canada. I am 28 years old. She did not bingo me on ANYTHING, just asked if I wanted to hear about other contraceptive options before explaining what the bisalp procedure entailed. The surgery went amazingly smooth, I’m in very minimal pain only a day later and recovering well. She is highly skilled at her work and I recommend her 100%.

Toronto: [Men's Health Institute](http://menshealthinstitute.ca) I approached them at 21 a week from my 22nd birthday, Dr Jarvi saw me and was very respectful of my reasoning. He just asked that I consult the other surgeon in the clinic for a second opinion first, which I did. Went in the day of, he was so good I didn't know he was working until he told me he was already done one side. Incredibly talented, no pain at all, and seemed as though he'd be open to 18 year olds so long as they show unwavering belief in their choice. They've only been open a year and change at the time of writing (22/06/2017) so they were a bit hard to find. Hoping to spread the word, good luck to you all!

+1 Dr. Jarvi. He was happy to provide me (18M) with a vasectomy, given a second consult with Dr. Krakowsky, to ensure my physical fitness. Ended up doing it with Dr. Krakowsky due to scheduling.

Toronto: [Dr. Yonah Krakowsky (MD FRCSC)](http://sexmd.ca/) - Mount Sinai Hospital - 60 Murray Street, 6th floor - I am an 18 year old male. I initially went to the Men's Health Institute  where Dr. Jarvi said he would give me a vasectomy, but first wanted to check with a second doctor to ensure that I am physically fit for one. I was referred to Dr. Krakowsky by him. Both Dr. Jarvi and Dr. Krakowsky were understanding of my desire to get this done and non-judgemental in their demeanour. I ultimately went with Dr. Krakowsky, as I was already at his office and Dr. Jarvi's schedule appeared to be a lot busier. The procedure itself was smooth and only took around 20 minutes. Dr. Krakowsky informed of me exactly what was going to happen before he did it, and talked with me throughout to help distract from any of the pain (the only real pain at the time of the procedure was the ~3 needles for anesthesia). I am writing this one week later and most of the swelling, bruising, and pain has died down. Dr. Jarvi and Dr. Krakowsky were the only ones willing to do the operation for me out of more than 5 urologist I tried to contact and I am very thankful for that. If you are in or near Toronto, and especially if you are young like me, this should be your first choice.

+1 Dr. Krakowsky. Jan 2023 Vasectomy on 18-year-old redditor.I went to my local walk in clinic after seeing Dr. Krakowsky on the CF friendly list, and asked for a referral to his office. They asked a few questions, I answered, and they sent in a referral. A few weeks later, and his office calls me to set up a brief phone call between the doctor and I, and he goes over the procedure and details with me. I chose a date during that call and a few more weeks later, I got operated on. Worth noting, I am an international student without a health card and on university health insurance, and neither of these were obstacles.

Toronto: [Ontario Men's Health Clinic] (http://www.ontariomenshealth.ca/contact). I am a 23 years old male. The doctor had no problem referring me to the surgeon for a vasectomy procedure. He asked some pretty basic questions. I'll probably update the wiki once I meet with the actual surgeon (Toronto Vasectomy Clinics). I have a long term relationship (almost 4 years) with my girlfriend (who is also childfree). So far it took only 1 week to get an appointment for the referral (Men's Health Clinic) and 1 month for the consultation with the surgeon. 

Toronto: Dr. Rajiv Shah (OBGYN), St. Michael's Hospital - 61 Queen Street East - I'm 29 and I was referred to Dr. Shah by my family doctor for sterilization. Dr. Shah was professional, didn't bingo me and had no problem performing the procedure. It took me about a year from the first appointment to the procedure but it was free. I highly recommend him.

Toronto: Dr Farzana Haq, Integra Health Centre - 1320-130 King Street West - I'm a 25 year old female. She Dr. Haq is a Family doctor at the clinic. Had no hesitations about giving me a referral to get Bilateral and also suggested my partner also get fixed as it is a faster procedure if we wanted to be doubly sure not to have any future mistakes. She didn't bingo me at all and offered to do the referral that day if I wanted.

Toronto: Dr Vivian Xia (Shaw). If anyone is in the greater Toronto  area and is looking for a great gp who is totally on board with bodily autonomy and womens right to choose Dr. Vivian Xia (pronounced Shaw) is amazing!! She immediately sent a new referral to a doctors I’ve heard great things about (Dr Brock McKinney). 

Toronto: Dr Sari Kives. St Michaels hospital. Super personable and made no mention of my partner and told me the risks and let me make the decision myself. I had a psychiatrist on hand to give me the second signature for provincial insurance coverage but she gladly signed off on the first. Highly recommend.

Toronto: [Dr. Leham](https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/R-Laham/0042824-56802) was the family doctor (not my family doctor, I was a walk-in patient) who wrote the referral the first time around, and [Dr. Satkunaratnam](https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/Satkunaratnam-Abheha/0139245-71197) was the surgical gynaecologist who performed the procedure. Everyone was very kind caring (including all on the surgical team, I was very nervous about surgery (because surgery, in general scares me) but the nurses and the doctors were very kind and helped me keep calm about it). The worst part was when the I.V. was put in. No bingos at all, they just asked if I was "120% sure", some small inquisition on motivations but nothing else (why I was getting it done so young and if I wanted to come when I was older they would still do it later but when I said I wanted it now as soon as possible they did it). If you need someone in the area I strongly recommend these doctors as they were amazing and I don't see many doctors in this area on the list for procedures for those that own a uterus.

Trillium Health Centre - Queensway Site 416-621-9700

Kitchener: Dr. Emma Wakim OBGYN. KARMA Clinic in Kitchener/Grand River Hospital. Referred by GP in January, consult in May. Surgery set for September, but got bumped twice to October and then November. Surgery was great! Tied my tubes using Filshie clips. I was 26 at the time of my consult, 27 when I had the surgery. Very no nonsense, listened to the short version of my argument, made sure I knew it was permanent, and then agreed to do the surgery.

Kitchener/Waterloo: Dr. Gillian Oliver OBGYN. Clinic in Waterloo/Surgery at Grand River Hospital. Tubal Ligation at age 22. Surgery was booked 4 months after my consultation, but took awhile from referral to consultation ~7 months. Consultation took ~10 minutes to convince her I was sure. 

Kitchener/Waterloo: [Dr. Andrew Stewart OBGYN](https://www.salhanistewart.com/) 30 Dupont Street East,
 L4 Waterloo, ON N2J 2G9. Double salpingectomy on a 23 year old woman (22 when referred). 5 month wait time for appointment, 4 month wait time until surgery.

Markham/Stouffville: Dr. Adeel Sheikh. Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgeon at Markham Stouffville Hospital. Vasectomy at age 24. Dr Sheikh is young, friendly, and very well informed. During the consultation, he asked about other birth control methods we could use, but did not press too much and did not question our decision. He made sure we understood that the vasectomy is permanent. Vasectomy was booked for 2 weeks after the consultation. He had no issues with us being a childfree couple in our mid 20's. Highly recommend getting a referral to him. 

North York: Dr. Grace Mariampallai OB/GYN. She works in the same office as [Ceres Fertilility Center](http://www.tofertility.ca/index.php); however, she is her seperate office, she has no website. Her phone number to her office is (four-10-six-223-9-one-one-4). She had a second opinion after she said yes, he was harder to confirm with and I would not suggest the same way. I had a bilateral laparosopy tubal coagulation, dilatation and curettage, and the removal of my mirena. Age 24F

Orillia: [Dr. Brock McKinney] OBGYN 705-558-2020 -- Tubal ligation, age 26. Five months from initial consult to surgery. Very nice, well informed, happy to do the procedure, but a bit paternalistic about removing tubes.

Second entry for Dr. McKinney - bisalp, age 29. Approx 3 months from initial consult to surgery. Thorough about options, good sense of humour, scars are tiny. Said "I believe in a woman's right to do what she wants with her body, so I will remove your tubes for you." Definitely recommend. 

Oakville: Dr. Len DeBolster - [So Simple Vasectomy Clinic](http://www.sosimplevasectomy.com/) - Great doctor, took 4 months from referral to consult, then another 3 from consult to vasectomy.  Had no problems for childless couple, 29M and 26F. 

Owen sound: Dr.  Emmanuel Caulley - obgyn did bilateral salpingectomy on me 6 weeks before my 25th birthday. Did have a 6 month wait for initial consultation then 3 months until an available surgical date. We had a quick interview, he was very respectful.  Day of the procedure he asked again if I'm positive, I said yes and he said "you are an adult and I will do my best for you". Due to previous surgeries he had trouble getting in so I have multiple small incisions but no big deal. He runs roughly 2 hours late for everything but overall nice guy. 

Owen Sound: Dr G Wignall - vasectomy, 29yo. The closest he came to a bingo was telling me that "if my circumstances change", insurance won't cover a reversal and I may have to go further away in order to find a surgeon to do it. He never once questioned my judgement or implied that I was wrong for not wanting children.

Ottawa/Cornwall: Dr. Bob Reddock. (Vasectomy) Won't see anyone without a referral, but if you do get one from any physician, he will see you. Very nice guy who is very understanding, and he told me, "If you are old enough to serve your country, you can make your own life choices." Less than a week from the time the referral was sent to when my consultation was. Very short waiting times. [Here is his website.](http://www.vasectomyontario.com/index.html)

Ottawa: Dr Wolfish. University of Ottawa Health Services. (https://med.uottawa.ca/obs-gyne/divisions/general-obstetrics-and-gynecology/staff-list/wolfish-karen) She's so fantastic! Surgery booked for a few months after my initial appointment! Not sure if you need a referral or not, but even if you do, totally worth the extra work! - Yes you do need a referral. Will not do the surgery on young (under 25) women but is willing to refer you to other doctors in the area who will.

-1 Dr Wolfish who may not be doing sterilisation procedures at present and is referring patients to other doctors. 

Ottawa: Dr. Glenn Posner. Origyns Medical Clininc (Surgery will be at Riverside Hospital). Wonderfully kind man who listened to my reasons and approved me at 23 years old. Surgery scheduled for 10 months after initial appointment. Update 3 Feb 2023: today, I received a call from their reception team saying Dr. Posner would officially not be doing hysterectomies anymore. 

Ottawa: Dr. Jessica Dy - Shirley Greenberg Women's Health Centre at Riverside Hospital (surgery at the Civic) - Absolutely wonderful Doctor. Requires referral from GP. Long appt wait time but worth it! 

Ottawa: [Dr. Marc Brulotte](https://ovic.clinic/). Got a vasectomy at 24 years old, I’ve been with my partner for almost 4 years, no children. I applied for a vasectomy online and received a call about 2 weeks later to book the appointment. Total wait time was about 2 months. Dr. Brulotte has coverage for Ontario (OHIP) and Quebec (RAMQ) health insurance. There is an optional after-care kit that can be reimbursed with private insurance. Prior to the procedure, Dr. Brulotte went over my file and asked me a few questions to make sure I was in the right state of mind to be making this decision. During the vasectomy, he talked me through the procedure and made sure I was comfortable.

Ottawa: Dr. Black and Dr. Lortie at the Ottawa Hospital. I originally got approved at 23, minimal questioning, unmarried and CF. The surgery team also said that bisalp is their go-to for sterilizations now, which was very reassuring.

Peterborough: Dr. Suzie Packenham, http://www.themedicalcentre.net/aboutus/physicians/pakenham.html

Peterborough: Dr. Peter Maskens, he did a bisalpingectomy on me at age 20, citing that research shows age has little to do with regret. Got me in within 5 months even during covid. Requires a referral from your GP. https://doctors.cpso.on.ca/DoctorDetails/Maskens-Peter-Duncan/0028685-33508. NB this doctor has since closed his practice. 

Peterborough: [Dr. Gerster, (The Medical Centre, 707 Charlotte Street)](https://www.themedicalcentre.net/aboutus/clinicians.html) and Christine Dallaire. Dr. Kate Gerster performed a bi-salpingectomy on me at 24 (with no previous kids). I needed a GP referral which took a few months to get an appointment. At the appointment she reviewed all forms of contraception with me (IUD, vasectomy, etc), but ultimately was very understanding and supportive of my choice to be childfree. To understand all my options we discussed the difference between a salpingectomy as well as a filshie clip ligation. I ended up deciding on the salpingectomy. OHIP covered costs. It took a few months between that appointment and surgery. She was incredibly understanding and supportive throughout the entire process.

Sarnia: Dr. Martin, Urologist. Age 22, approved for vasectomy but wanted me to wait 3 months to see if I was sure about it. Day of procedure asked again and then went with the procedure. He said he doesn't normally do people this young though so have good reasons for wanting it done.

Smiths Falls: Dr. Cecilia Kerner, OBGYN, Perth &amp;amp; Smiths Falls District Hospital. Referral required. She approved me for a bilateral salpingectomy at our first appointment and performed the surgery the following month. She is amazing, so supportive and kind. She understood that I was serious, and treated me with total respect and understanding. Highly recommend her. 

Stratford: [Dr. Simon Deluce MD OBGYN](https://www.stratfordobgyn.ca/) 360 Huron St, Stratford, ON N5A 5T5, (519) 272-2988.  Bisalp on 30F. He did not bingo me at all. Referral is required. My family doctor sent a referral in June, I was called within a week for a consultation in September, and my surgery was in November 2022.

Sudbury: Dr. Bishwajit Bora, Urologist, Northern Urology Centre, 705-673-6836. Age 23, Approved for vasectomy and procedure was done on March 23, 2015. He was very polite and open minded. Didn't require any convincing, just a few questions before hand, then signed the paperwork! Be confident in your choice! If you are not 100% sure, from what he has said, he won't do the procedure. Don't show any uncertainty. Good Luck! :)

Sudbury: Dr. Splinter, OBGYN, Neo Women's Health Network, 705-222-0492. Age 26, approved for a salpingectomy. I waited 6 months for my first appointment with her, but the whole clinic is very much "it's your body and your choice", they just wanted to make sure I was aware of all the options and what the procedure would entail. I received my surgery 3 months later and it went well.

Sudbury: Dr. Jocko, OBGYN, Neo Womens' Health Network, 705-222-0492. Age 30, approved for laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. I had to get a referral and it was about a 3 month wait until my appointment with Dr. Jocko. My appointment was November 4th 2019, and I had my surgery March 4th 2020. No bingos, everyone at the clinic and hospital (Health Sciences North) are super nice. Dr. Jocko herself is a very friendly and professional doctor. 

Toronto: Dr. Ally Murji, Mount Sinai Hospital and clinics at Women's College Hospital. (Essure) Was referred to Women's College Hospital by PPToronto. Be prepared to wait a few months before your appointment - they're very busy.

Toronto: Dr. Les Spevack, North York General Hospital. Family doctor referral to consultation to vasectomy: 5 months. No questions asked as a single 23M. Explained procedure and set up the surgery appointment on the spot in 10 minutes.

Toronto: Dr. Modupe Tunde-Byass, 5 Fairview Mall Dr and North York General. Approved for tubal ligation, very quick to get surgery scheduled could have had it done within the month. Single, 28 she asked questions and offered other methods but saw that I am competent and knew what I wanted.

Toronto: Dr. Paul Cohen, Dermatologist, Rosedale Dermatology Centre - 1366 Yonge Street, Suite 306, 416-487-3453, http://www.drpaulcohen.com . It's a long wait to see him but he is a great dermatologist who knows his stuff and is open minded with treatments. I use spironolactone for menstrual cycle breakouts, and he reminds me at appointments not to get pregnant on the drug or else I would need an abortion. This is likely for liability purposes. Even when mentioning being childfree he's never bingoed me. He has also never withheld the prescription on the off-chance that I'd be pregnant, or changed the treatment for that reason. While this is only my experience, I doubt that other women would be bingoed by him if they needed Accutane, for example. 

Waterloo: Dr. Balraj Singh, 430 The Boardwalk, Suite 208, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N3Y 0C1. Phone (519) 742-0107. I believe Dr. Singh's traditional clients are dad's who do not want more kids, as he was initially confused when I said I was single and CF. After getting over the confusion, Dr. Singh had no problems setting up a no-scalpel vasectomy. Had dates lined up, I could have had the vasectomy a week after the pre-op. OHIP covers vasectomies, so there was no cost, but as Dr. Singh only does vasectomies on Thursdays, taking time off of work might be the only consideration to make.

Windsor: Dr. Michelle Susanne Suga Rak 2425 Tecumseh Road East, Windsor, Ontario, N8W 1E6 (519) 254-6461. Bilateral salpingectomy on 27-year-old  woman.  She was very nice, non-judgmental and respectful. and she listened. She just asked me if I was sure I didn’t want children. She prefers doing laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 

Windsor: Dr. Rawlins, Jenna Rae. South Walkerville Medical Centre, Suite 340, 2224 Walker Road, Windsor ON  N8W 3P5. Phone: (519) 258-1592 Bilateral salpingectomy on 32-year old woman. She asked me once during consult if I was sure and once on the day of the procedure and that was it. Took me seriously. It was a good experience.

Windsor: Dr. Bradley Jasey, 2224 Walker Rd suite 340, Windsor Ontario Canada, N8W 5L7, 519-258-1592. Performed bilateral salpingectomy on childfree 27F. Friendly and professional.

Woodstock: Dr. Dragana Matanovic-Todorovic Woodstock, Ontario, Canada 519-533-6962 Need referral from primary doctor. Tubal ligation. OP followed up to let us know the doctor performed full tube removal to prevent cancer. 

####Manitoba

Winnipeg: [Dr. Errol Billinkoff](https://bvc.mb.ca/doctor.html). 1 appointment to consult, 1 appointment to have the procedure, 1 follow up.  Respected my decision based on age and education.

Winnipeg: [Dr. Helen Pymar](https://sogc.org/en/en/rise/Contacts/ContactLayouts/speaker-profile-en.aspx?ID=109967), located in HSC Hospital's Women's Centre. She performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 29 year old woman in 2022. During the initial consultation she asked a few questions to make sure I was aware of the alternative options (IUD etc) but didn't bingo me. She originally suggested a tubal ligation with filshie clips but agreed to the bilateral salpingectomy.

- +1 Dr. Helen Pymar of the HSC Women's Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 28 y/o childfree woman. No bingoes, simply wanted to verify that I had considered all other methods of birth control first. Very straightforward and professional woman, and her team was very friendly. No bingoes from any of the assisting doctors, nurses, or PA student she had with her. Very happy with my experience.

- +1 Dr. Helen Pymar out of HSC Hospital. Agreed to tubal ligation with Filshie Clips on 23 year old woman in 2019.

Winnipeg: Dr. Devon Ambrose, Tache Obstetrics &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Gynecology. At this clinic they said that they require two doctors to approve a sterilization on a younger person (26F), though Dr. Ambrose was very open minded and understanding, so that might have just been the first Doctor that I saw saying that. Dr. Ambrose said that I'm an adult and the only person that can 100% know me, so it was my decision. He talked about how regret rates are actually quite skewed and that it's the patient's decision in the end. Tubal ligation scheduled June 2016!

+1 Dr Ambrose. I was not told that I needed two doctors to approve, however this may have had something to do with my family doctor, who referred me, being on my side and saying that she supported me in the referral. He didn't seem delighted to be doing the operation on someone so young (25F) but was nevertheless willing and supportive. I think he appreciated that I said outright that even were it not for being CF, I'd rather adopt. He wanted me to wait a couple months after the consultation to let everything sit, but it ended up being that the pre-op appointment and surgery all got booked within a month and a half of the initial consultation, very speedy! Can't be happier with how everything went and I highly recommend him to others! 

+1 Dr. Ambrose, although the process was slow. Requested a referral to him in July of 2019 and had my appointment in November, where Dr. Ambrose was very supportive. My appointment for the required second opinion was the following February. Bisalp was initially scheduled for March but due to COVID was pushed back and was instead performed September 2020. I had no pre-op appointment, which I thought was strange, but then again we did fill out all the necessary forms during my initial appointment so maybe that's why none was needed. Overall very pleased with Dr. Ambrose and would recommend him to anyone else seeking a bisalp in MB.

Winnipeg: Dr. Heather Ring, Tache Obstetrics &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Gynecology. My OB/GYN was Dr. Ambrose (above), but she was the doctor that gave the required second referral and she had no hesitations giving it for an unmarried nulliparous 27 year old. The entire appointment she kept restating that her questions were only a formality so that she could tick the required boxes.

Winnipeg: Dr. Vivian Lee: She is out of the Manitoba Medical Clinic (you'll need a referral) she is willing to perform a Tubal Ligation on women as long as they know what they are doing and understand this is permanent. She is pretty liberal thankfully. She has scheduled mine (24f) for February 2017. The type of tubal ligation is the clip method.  

Winnipeg: Dr. Mark Bernier out of the Manitoba Clinic. Provided tubal ligation with Filshie Clips on 23 year old woman in 2010. Needed a referral from a GP to see him, took about a month to get an appointment, had the surgery 3 weeks later.

Winnipeg: Dr. Jay Buenafe: He runs Circumcision and Vasectomy Clinic at 930 Jefferson Avenue Suite 203, Winnipeg, Manitoba. I went there when I was 26 years old, told him I have no child of my own and I don't want to have one of my own. I also told him I have big family with lots of uncles/aunts and cousins. He didn't fact check me or anything. He simply asked me to book an appointment. The type of vasectomy is scalpel-free. Phone: 204-997-9782 Website: https://buenafeclinic.com/ or www.vasectomymanitoba.ca

Winnipeg: Dr. Leslea Walters at https://millenniummedical.ca/ in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She performed a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy on me at 25F. A second opinion was needed but she led the process. Initial consult was Nov 21, had surgery in Sept 22 after 2 reschedules due to surgery space not being available (original was in May). Very easy and enjoyable clinic to deal with, did not feel pushed to rethink my choice at all.

+1 Dr. Walters. April 2023. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on 30F. Dr. Walters was very kind and and supportive of my decision. I felt very at ease during my interactions with her. No bingos and no talk of regret statistics, just proper informed consent regarding the procedure. 10/10 for bedside manner as well.


####New Brunswick 

Fredericton: "I've recently helped a friend who was being denied a referral to get a tubal with finding a clinic that would give her one (a referral), but I don't have experience with the doctor, other than what I was told over the phone. They have told me they respect bodily autonomy and don't discriminate by age, and would be happy to give her a referral." The clinic is [Clinic 554](http://www.clinic554.ca/), where the old Morgentaler abortion clinic used to be. 554 Brunswick Street, Fredericton NB E3B 1H5. Toll Free: 1-855-978-5434 Phones are answered: Tuesday - Thursday, 11:00AM - 2:30PM & 3:30PM - 7:00PM 

Fredericton: "I recently inquired about getting a vasectomy from [Dr. Kevie Christie](https://gentleproceduresnb.ca/). I was able to set an appointment within a month. I was given two options, I could be referred by a doctor and only pay $200 or refer myself and pay $600. While there there is a consultation just to make sure you agree. The doctor does not trying to talk you out of it, and respects your choice. On the day of the surgery he has the nurses prepare a package of ice packs,pills,ect for you to take with you to reduce the need of running around. In addition he does the no scalpel technique which reduces healing time. I really recommend him for anyone considering a straightforward procedure." The clinic is at 1015 Regent Street, Suite 304 , and they have a website detailing all information you may need. 506-443-7623

Moncton/Dieppe: Dr Sylvie Nadeau 100 Olivier St Unit B, Dieppe NB E1A 1S9 (506) 383-4205. I (27f, childfree) got referred to Dr Nadeau in April 2021 for a bilateral salpingectomy and had my first consultation in May 2022. She was very informative and did not bingo me. She did have to refer me to her colleague in the same gynaecologist clinic to make sure I was 100% willing to do this. The other Dr gave the OK and by July 21st 2022 I was sterilized. Very supportive doctor’s, they understood I was serious and did not try to change my mind.

Dieppe: Dr. Samuel Jean 100 Olivier St. Unit B Dieppe, New Brunswick E1A 1S9 (506) 383-4201. My GP sent my referral in June 2021, and I (26 at the time, FTM transgender) had my first appointment with Dr. Jean in December 2021 to discuss sterilization options. We went over all the available options and some of my concerns (mainly regarding ovary preservation as a "backup" if access to T is lost, and whether my chronic inflammatory condition would be an issue during surgery), and after this I decided on bilateral salpingectomy. He never tried to change my mind or "bingo" me at any point in the process. The surgery was completed on March 8th, 2022. He performs laparoscopic surgery, and his technique for bisalp only leaves three incisions/scars. He is very knowledgeable and thorough in his explanations, and is overall a wonderful doctor to deal with. He is LGBT-friendly and trained in trans healthcare as well. If you're comfortable with a male gynecologist, I highly recommend this doctor.

####Nova Scotia

Halifax: Dr. David Rittenberg, Dept of Obstetrics and Gynecology, IWK. 26 y/o female referred by my GP late October, consult in Feb, will have IUD inserted in 4-6 weeks. Went over all options re: permanent and non-permanent contraception, with pros and cons of each. His exact words: "I'm willing to perform a ligation on a younger person because at the end of the day, you're an adult, and you'd be taking care of the baby, not me." Did go over the whole psychological studies re: regret, but stated that "studies" does not equal "patient sitting across from me". Even told me the cheapest place to fill the prescription for the Mirena. Wonderful man! 

Dr. Glenn Andrea | Dalhousie Health & Wellness Centre, a referral is required which can be provided by [Halifax Sexual Health Centre (HSHC)](https://hshc.ca/vasectomy-referrals/) in a 5 minute call appt. 27M, single, childfree, vasectomy. Referred by Halifax Sexual Health Centre (HSHC) by making an phone appointment for vas referral - minimal pushback, mainly a few questions to gauge seriousness (5 minute call). Dr. Andrea's office called 3 weeks later to schedule the consult+vas at the same time for a month after (2 months total after referral). Dr. Andrea was on-time and very professional. He only asked two questions: are you sure, and do you understand that it is permanent. $100 tray fee was the only cost.

Dr Nancy Van Eyk, at the IWK health center. She did my consultation as well as my surgery. No pushback at all: “you’re old enough to know” Referral is necessary, but another redditor already provided the link to the Halifax sexual health center. The whole staff I spoke to were lovely, great bedside manner, and were very understanding of my nervousness. I myself am a 35 year old woman, not single, and now, properly childfree. 5850/5980 University Avenue Halifax, Nova Scotia B3K 6R8

Dr Cassell, performed Total Bilateral Salpingectomy on 21F, after about one year waiting for a surgery date due to COVID-19. Very supportive and friendly. No questions asked, just signed the consent forms. Also inserted a Mirena IUD at the same time.

Dr Fady Mansour, Royal Victoria Hospital (McGill Health Center), and Dr Andrew Zakhari, 5100 Boul. de Maisonneuve Ouest 6e Etage, Montréal, QC H4A 3T2. Dr Zakhari is AMAZING i could truly kiss this man. Hysterectomy 26F. 514.228.8889. I was referred to this team by Dr Annie Leung who is Gynecologic Oncology at McGill. 

Montreal: [Dr. Andrée Sansregret MD](https://www.centreobgyn.ca/en/) Montreal, Quebec. April 2023. Doctor will only perform surgery on patients 30 years and older. Doctor is body-positive. Bisalp on 34-year-old unmarried redditor. Surgery was performed at Hôpital Ste-Justine and was free with RAMQ. The doctor truly listened to my arguments and didn't infantilize me. I felt respected during the appointment and she informed me very well of the procedures available. After that initial agreement, there was never any further comment on my decision. I will add, as a fat woman, that my body wasn't seen as an issue or an indicator of my health, which was also very appreciated. Come prepared to the appointment, but don't fear endless questions.

Montreal: Dr. Elroy Shuker, Montreal Vasectomy https://vasectomie-montreal.ca/en/contact/ 514-447-2332 6900 Boulevard Décarie, Suite #M270, Montréal. Private clinic (reasonable fees), performed vasectomy on 29 year old man without bingoes or invasive questioning. Appointment easily made online; no need for referral required. As of summer 2020, this clinic does no-needle, no-scalpel vasectomies with fascial interposition and cauterization of the abdominal end of the vas, with the testicular end left open (this is one of the three methods recommended by the American Urological Association). 

Montreal: Vasectomy. Dr Nicolas Nélisse. Private clinic (http://www.votrevasectomie.ca/index.en.html). "No scalpel" method. Called to get info, got appointment instead. No questions asked. Quick procedure, almost felt nothing. It was over in a few minutes. He has been doing about 1000 vasectomies per year for over 18 years. 150$ (10h 0m) for meds. Everything else paid for by Quebec Health Insurance (RAMQ). I would totally recommend him.

+1 Dr Nélisse, Was hard to find a spot fitting with my schedule because they are (obviously) very busy. Went there, got the operation done at 26, no questions, no judgements, no bingos. Everything was free under the RAMQ.

Montreal: Dr. Kevin Zorn (http://urochum.ca/wp/?page_id=153). referred to by GP for a vasectomy. Bilingual (French and English), made me feel at ease immediately and extremely knowledgeable. With his "no scalpel" method, I barely felt anything and was out the door in less than 20 min. It also minimizes scarring, as only one small incision is needed. He respected my decision to become sterile at a young age (he says that anyone over 18 is old enough to make that decision) and only asked me the standard questions (you know this is permanent? you know of the possible complications? etc.). I totally recommend him to anyone who considers a vasectomy. The entire procedure cost was $300 (20h 0m) flat.

Montreal: Dr. Sonia Gagnon. Referred by another gyno who refused to do my tubal. She was very nice during the consult. She asked me polite questions and wasn't condescending. I was put the hospital waiting list &amp;amp; it took about 6 months. Everyone was polite and respectful with me during the process. I was 22 when approved for my tubal (Filshie Clips).

Montreal: Dr. Marie-Eve Murray. She doesn't take new patients without a referral so I got one from my GP. She made sure I understood the procedure I wanted (bilateral salpingectomy) was permanent and explained me all the risks and non-permanent alternatives. I took another appointment with her one month later (she wanted me to wait at least one month to be sure it was what I wanted) and I signed the documents. I got fixed less than 2 months later and everything went smoothly, no one bingoed me the day of the surgery (I was only 23).

Montreal: Dr. Nathalie Bleau. She was very understanding of my (30F) desire to never have children. She was amused by my sterilization binder, and said that doctors should not refuse sterilization for informed childfree women. As long as women are well-informed about the risks and alternatives available, she sees no reason to deny them a bilateral salpingectomy. She agreed that a complete bisalp was a better option than a partial bisalp or tubal ligation, due to its increased effectiveness and equivalent invasiveness, and is what she would choose for herself were she to get sterilized as well. 10/10 for her helpfulness and receptiveness to the CF. You do need a referral to see her though.

+1 Dr Bleau. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor Oct. 2022. "Major shoutout to Dr. Bleau and the amazing team at RocklandMD in Montreal, they made the whole process very easy and I felt very well taken care of."

Montreal:  Dr M.-Y. Arsenault (Obgyn) He works out of the Lasalle Hospital in Montréal. Needed a referal to get the consult. He encouraged me to perform a bisalp for both the sterilisation and cancer benefits which I appreciated. I got no bingo along the whole journey from any of the medical or surgical staff. Wait time from referral to surgery was 8 months. If you have a RAMQ card the procedure is free. [OP's journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/11mdslc/bisalp_done_truely_a_wonderful_womans_day/). 

Laval: Dr Hanna Nicholas, bilateral salpingectomy for 20yo. "He doesn't judge you and respects your choices". 

Longueuil: I got a referral to go see Dr Marie Catherine L'Amoureux from my GP because hormonal birth control was putting me at risk. I had prepared a folder with studies for any bingo that could be thrown my way, but I didn't need it. She listened to me and my concerns. She understood that I was looking for a permanent solution, that I had been with my spouse for a decade (27 F) so I was in a stable solution. It took 6 months for the hospital to call me to schedule the appointment. On the day of the appointment, I was treated with respect. They helped make me comfortable. Some nurses asked me what the reasoning was behind me getting sterilised so young, but they understood. 

NB another member writes, "Hello! I went to see Dr Marie-Catherine L'Amoureux (Longueuil, Canada) when I found her on the list. She is not childfree-friendly to women under 30 and will be condescending." and "I got every bingo in the book and she said that at my age (23F) she wouldn't feel comfortable to sterilize me because what if I change my mind, since we can't see the future." 

Quebec City: Dr. Mathieu Leboeuf and the gynecology department at CHUL (Centre hospitalier de l'Université Laval). Approved 29/F for bilateral salpingectomy. They are hesitant to sterilize women under 30, but willing to listen if you go in prepared. They initially offered a tubal ligation with Filshie clips, but they OKed a bi-salp. Typical Québec waiting lists for both consultation and surgery (3 months, 6-7 months respectively). You must be covered by the RAMQ to access services here.

Sherbrooke: Josianne Paré (Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke: 3001, 12e Avenue N, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada, J1H 5N4). Bilateral salpingectomy.

###Argentina

- [Dr. Juan José Sardi](https://www.hospitalbritanico.org.ar/) at the Hospital Británico in 74 Perdriel Street, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bilateral salpingectomy. 27F, single, childfree, the only BC I used was pills, and they did not force me to try another before getting the procedure done. EXCELLENT experience, no bingoes whatsoever, every single nurse and doctor was fantastic, and so far my recovery has been smooth. The first appointment did take a little bit of time (asked for it in February, got it for mid-April) but since then, it was less than a month and a half for me to get the procedure done (June 10th). Insurance covered everything, but it's protected by two laws in Argentina.

Dra Andrea Fabiana Velazco - Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires I'm 31F and single. At first I had a consultation with Dr. Adrián Saavedra Sánchez who read my medical records and noted that I previously had asked for bilateral salpingectomy (this was a telephone consultation during the pandemic). I explained that I was ok with a tubal because abortion is legal now in Argentina. Then he printed the consent for the surgery and refered me to Dra. Andrea Velazco with whom I had another consultation. No bingoes whatsoever.

###Brasil

- Goiânia/GO, Brazil - [Dr. Hélio Finotti](https://heliofinotti.com.br/). I've been through a vasectomy with him at 33 years old without kids. He was very direct and polite, didnt try to convince me not to make the surgery, which shocked me at first, because I tried 2 doctors before him and was treated like I was about to commit a crime. Since the insurance plan had to be approved by an external team, I decide to pay for myself (was about 1.100BRL).

- São Paulo / Aracaju - Sergip, - [Bruno Garcia Dias](https://www.drbrunogarcia.com.br/). I made my appointment through a site called [vidia](https://www.souvidia.com/). This is a site to do private surgeries, without the need of an insurance plan. I didn't have to wait 60 days or to consult an psychologist, he did warn me about regret since I'm 26, but did the surgery anyways saying that in the end was my choice, and that him as a doctor should just explain to me that he is not responsible for regrets. The total price through Vidia is 1900BRL, but he said that directly with him would be something like 1800BRL.

###Trinidad and Tobago 

- San Fernando - Dr. Vishal Bahall, Gulf View Medical Centre Gulf View, San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago - (868) 285 4862. I had a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy at 34, single, with no children. I have spoken to many gynaecologists here and he was the only one even willing to entertain the prospect of sterilizing me. I have no insurance and the cost was $34,000 (TT dollars) so a little over $5k USD. I didn't have a binder but had done plenty of research over the years and went in prepared and knowing my stuff. He did suggest an IUD which I declined, but didn't really give me any pushback other than that as I was clear on what I wanted. The wait time was long because I had to arrange time off of work - if not for that I could have had it done probably two or three weeks after the consult.

###South Africa

- [Marie Stopes Clinics](https://www.mariestopes.org.za/) - No-scalpel Vasectomy. I (27M at time of vasectomy) was given no hassles. I basically "ordered" a vasectomy. I was only questioned once why I wanted a vasectomy, and this was after I had already paid for everything, one the day of the vasectomy, and it was mostly out of the doctor's curiosity. It cost me R2200 (the year 2019). [You can read about my experience here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vasectomy/comments/eltf63/got_the_snip_today_want_to_share_my_experience/)

- Pretoria - [Dr. Hannelie Pienaar](http://www.drpienaar.com) (Bisalp and endometrial ablation for 31F. At 26 when I first enquired she was not comfortable doing the procedure; but at 31 she actually suggested it to me after having issues with BC, since she knew I wanted to be sterilised. Scheduled for a week later. Met me the morning before the op to confirm I understood I would be sterile after the procedure. No bingos. Very friendly and helpful staff at Die Wilgers Hospital)

- Cape Town - [Dr Shaun Smit](https://www.urologycapetown.co.za/). I am 24m, unmarried, with no children. Received a bilateral vasectomy. Process was hassle free, went in for a consultation and was booked for the procedure 2 weeks later. Doctor did list some bingos but was happy once I made it clear I was doing the procedure for myself, and that I had put a lot of thought into it.
