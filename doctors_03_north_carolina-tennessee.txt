**Albemarle**

Dr. Brandner Atrium Women’s Health Stanley, 105 Yadkin St #102, Albemarle, North Carolina 28001. (980) 323-5330. 31 years old, never had children and do not want them. Not married but in a relationship. No medical reason to have one either but when two iuds failed and needs removed and I said I wanted my tubes tied he didn’t hesitate. Reviewed options, pros and cons and got me scheduled all within a month.

[Dr. Ashley Navarro, MD, MPH](https://missionhealth.org/provider-finder/profile/53195): MAHEC OB/GYN Specialists
119 Hendersonville Rd.,Asheville NC 28803 Asheville NC. (828) 771-5500. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am fellowship trained in Complex Family Planning (abortion, permanent contraception, and complex contraception) following an ObGyn residency. I have no restrictions other than patient is not being coerced by another party. I have no age, marital, or parity restrictions and fully support Child-free by Choice persons. I am trained to perform laparoscopic salpingectomy and laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation with Filshie clips. I do have partners who can take a vaginal approach, but I cannot speak to their practices regarding above restrictions. If you have Medicaid, be prepared to wait 30 days from signing the Medicaid consent. You can sign with any provider and they can refer to me. Make sure your name on the consent is the EXACT same as what is on your medicaid card.

*Note with regards to Asheville Urology Associates - a receptionist has advised one of our members that the practice will no longer sterilise under 25 year olds with no children.*

[Dr. Michael B. Burris](http://ashevilleurological.com/dr-burris.cfm) Comfortable with sterilizing a young person (23 yo) but will remind you that it is permanent birth control. Consultation for vasectomy lasted about 15 minutes, accepted the reasons of "just never wanted them", did a quick checkup, and then scheduled me. Understood that I had done my research and have made my decision. Does three separate measures to make sure it never reattaches, very thorough.

[Dr. James Brien](https://ashevilleurological.com/dr-brien.cfm) - Vasectomy and cauterization, no clamps. 34 years old, never married, no children. Doctor did a consultation and asked if I had any kids, then explained the process. Procedures are done every other Friday and Tuesday. Did not bingo me at any point or try to convince me not to do it. We chatted during the procedure and he told me he had refused the procedure to someone, it was an 18-year-old freshly married, but we didn't discuss the cutoff specifically. Very good with local anesthesia, didn't feel anything after the initial prick. His report afterwards said he removed at least 1 cm of vas on each side, but when I saw it, it looked like a solid inch.

[Dr. Franklin](https://ashevilleurological.com/dr-franklin.cfm) with Asheville Urological Associates at 1 Hospital Drive, Asheville, North Carolina. Early 30's single child-free male. Bilateral vasectomy. An initial ~15-30 minute consultation to go over the procedure and an examination to make sure everything felt normal. No attempts to influence my decision, simply asked if I had any children (I don't) and made sure I was aware it is considered permanent even though it is reversible. The procedure was 3 weeks later and took about 20 minutes. Cigna insurance covered the procedure completely except for the sperm test ($60), but was informed that without insurance it would have been $643

Dr. Courtney Cohen. Biltmore OBGYN (24 Medical Park Dr Asheville NC 28803). Bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation. No bingos (made sure I know it's permanent and that I know about other options, but didn't argue with me what-so-ever). Very respectful and kind. I'm 34 and unmarried.

+1 Dr Cohen: I’m 25f, married and wanted to update/let you know that Courtney Cohen on the Asheville NC list approved me for bilateral salpingectomy with very little arguing. Understanding the differences between they types of surgery and using “buzz words” (such as “I do not want biological children, it is not in my or husbands long term goal, we value our financial freedom” etc) let her just run you through the standard risks and typical questions that she quote “had to ask so that I can check off that you are certain”. All of that office (Biltmore OBGYN) knows how/does that specific surgery often and we’re very kind and calming. They walk you through the process, but I will be having a pre-op appointment with her and having the operation in July.

+1 Dr. Courtney Cohen from Asheville NC. She agreed for a bilateral salpingectomy on a 24 year old, unmarried with no kids. She stated she doesn't have an "age limit" to when she will do the procedure. The default for this practice is a bilateral salpingectomy as opposed to other sterilization techniques.

[Dr Susan West](https://laurelobgyn.com/dr-susan-west/), she works for Laruel OBGYN in Asheville. I recently went to ask for sterilization. I am 26 woman with no children. I had the best doctor's experience I've ever had there. She asked me thoughtful questions without being judgmental and with no pressure. She supported my decision for a tubal ligation while answering all of my specific questions about the surgery. She also gave me a great suggestion to get genetic testing to advocate for a salpingectomy instead of a tubal ligation (There is quite a few individuals in my family with breast cancer).

[Dr. Lindsay Veazey at Laurel OBGYN](https://laurelobgyn.com) and spoke about getting a tubal ligation. I’m unmarried, 29 year old with no children. She was instantly supportive. I asked about ectopic pregnancies and she said she’s actually removing the whole Fallopian tube now so it would be a salpingectomy instead. The only thing she wanted me to do first was speak to my neurosurgeon about coordinating recovery times between the salpingectomy and another potential surgery. She said that she is willing to do this surgery on young women without children and thinks anyone at her office would be.

[Dr. Laura Carlton at Biltmore OBGYN Asheville NC](https://missionhealth.org/provider-finder/profile/52905). Bilateral salpingectomy, 26, not married but have a bf of almost 3 years, CF. No bingo at all, she was amazingly supportive! I went through 3 drs before her. Just out of curiosity and AFTER she had approved my surgery, she asked what the previous drs reasoning was to refuse me. She did check that I knew birth control options beforehand but once I verified I knew my options and wanted this, she was behind me all the way. She also performed the surgery vaginally instead of through my abdomen. I'm a little over 1 week post op and recovery has been amazing!

[Dr. Franklin](https://ashevilleurological.com/dr-franklin.cfm) with Asheville Urological Associates at 1 Hospital Drive, Asheville, North Carolina. Early 30's single child-free male. Bilateral vasectomy. An initial ~15-30 minute consultation to go over the procedure and an examination to make sure everything felt normal. No attempts to influence my decision, simply asked if I had any children (I don't) and made sure I was aware it is considered permanent even though it is reversible. The procedure was 3 weeks later and took about 20 minutes. Cigna insurance covered the procedure completely except for the sperm test ($60), but was informed that without insurance it would have been $643

[Dr. Catherine Kurtz](https://www.ashevillewomens.com/our-providers/kurtz/). Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am 27, in a relationship, not married, and have no kids. I first spoke with Dr. Catherine Kurtz, my gynecologist, about sterilization. At the time, I didn’t know she did these surgeries. She seemed to fully support my decision to go permanent. She performed the surgery at Mission Hospital in Asheville, NC. Everything seemed to go well!

**Chapel Hill**

[Dr. Sonya Williams](https://chapelhillobgyn.com/our-team/#providers). Bilateral salpingectomy. She performed my bisalp in 2020, when I was 23. She asked me my reasoning for wanting sterilization, didn't argue with me or try to talk me out of it, and even agreed with me that bisalps are superior to tubal ligation and fought with my insurance to get them to cover the bisalp after they claimed they'd only cover a tubal. It took ~2 months between my initial appointment and the date of my surgery. I'm also agender and she was very respectful of my identity.

[Dr. R. Matthew Coward](https://www.med.unc.edu/urology/directory/r-matthew-coward-md-facs/) Urology, Pronounced "Cow-er," Vasectomy for 21 year old. Had a few questions for me during consultation, but after answering with well-thought out responses (did a lot of research on here) he seemed satisfied. Never tried to talk me out of it or change my mind.

[Dr. Michael Evers](https://www.med.unc.edu/obgyn/directory/michael-evers/) OBGYN, Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy, 23, not married (polyamorous including a long term committed relationship with a male partner). At an in person consultation, I explained my reasoning, and Dr. Evers genuinely listened and explained the typical ACOG spiel, but clarified that that's basically part of the gig, and agreed to do the bisalp. He understood my reasoning and was thorough but never condescending. Even the day of the surgery (about a month later), he said "I know what your answer will be, but I'm required to ask: are you sure you want to do this?" My insurance covered it 100% because I'm in the UNC system, and everyone who worked with me was very kind.

[Dr. Joshua Hardison](http://chapelhillobgyn.com/our-providers/physicians-physician-assistant/joshua-l-hardison-md/) OBGYN. Tubal ligation but lots of questions and he said he thought I would change my mind. 

+1 Dr Hardison My experience with Dr. Hardison was great, but I also came in very informed and confident in my decision. He did not try to dissuade me or tell me I would regret it. We reviewed the various options and risks and decided to tie the tubes. He paid special attention to my health and history to help me make the most informed decision. 

[Amy Bryant, MD, MSCR](https://www.med.unc.edu/obgyn/Patient_Care/specialty-services/family-planning) UNC OBGYN Family Planning Bilateral salpingectomy for 25 y/o, 28y/o, 24y/o, 27y/o, 21y/o, 23y/o and 21y/o. Current wait times for surgery are 5mo+ (after consultation). 

[Dr. Anne Martinelli](https://chapelhillobgyn.com/), Chapel Hill OBGYN (surgery performed at the North Carolina Specialty Hospital). Bilateral Salpingectomy via Laparotomy. 27yo childfree. Dr. Martinelli is incredibly nice and has a great sense of humor. No bingos, she made the process very smooth and I did not have to convince her to do it at all. She highly respects her patients’ bodily autonomy.

**Charlotte** 

[Dr. Ebony Parson](https://www.novanthealth.org/pf/providers/1588950729/ebony-parson/about-me) Novant Health Bradford Clinic OB/GYN – Ballantyne, 12611 North Community House Road, Suite 200, Charlotte, NC 28277. Body-positive doctor. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor who was very  pleased with her care. "I had my bisalp with her (30, no kids/husband/partner, considered obese at time of surgery)."

Dr. Jheel Shah in Charlotte, NC practices with Novant health. Performed bisalp on unmarried woman in mid 20s, with no kids or prior pregnancies. No bingos, no push back. Very respectful, caring, and understanding. Required a pre-op appt prior to surgery date set.

Rachel Tanis, she's a FNP but I went to see her as an OB/GYN. She was super sweet and gentle with my exam and when I told her I wanted my tubes tied, she didn't say that I'd regret it or question my decision at all. She told me it's completely my choice. She works at Novant Health Harbor Pointe OB/GYN in Denver, NC. 22yo F CF. 

Sarah Pollock, MD Emily Hutcheson, MD Daphne Capek, MD Jada Fambrough, MD. We are at Eastover Ob/Gyn at Atrium Health in Charlotte, NC. We are at the CMC main campus. I would like to be added to the list of surgeons that help child free patients obtain sterilization. My partners I have also operated with and would like to be on the list as well. 21+ 

Joshua Counihan at Atrium Eastover. I had to wait about 2 months for an initial appointment, I went in prepared to make my case however he didn't bingo or press for me to convince him that I was sure. Asked me why I wanted the procedure, accepted my answer, and then later on in the appointment repeated that for legal reasons he has to make sure I understand that this is permanent, irreversible, and it means I will never get pregnant unless it is through IVF. Answering yes he then proceeded to pre-op and scheduling stuff, which took another 3 months. The actual surgery went perfectly, I felt great after about a week and just had my 2 week follow-up where he cleared me from any post op restrictions. Overall awesome experience. He's sharp, thorough, but kind and calm. 100% recommend!!

[Dr. Daniel L. Watson](https://urologyspecialistsnc.com/medical-staff/daniel-l-watson-m-d), Urologist. Approved and performed a vasectomy on a 30-year-old. Was supportive, informative, and unbiased. He did ask how many children we had, but was unfazed when we said none. He did mention that the success rate for reversing vasectomies isn't great, so don't go into it unless we were sure. As soon as we confirmed that we wanted to move forward, he said, "great, let's get you on the schedule." He made us feel very comfortable. He was also hilarious and great to work with.

[Dr. Lisa Wilson] (https://www.nhprovidenceobgyn.org/our-providers.aspx) Tubal.  Super supportive, very professional and generally just great to work with.
**Edit 2020-01-07:** Currently not taking new patients. But please call to verify yourself as this status may change yet again, this is just a cautionary notice.

[Dr. Thomas H. Phillips](http://www.urologyspecialistsnc.com/medical-staff/physicians/thomas-h-phillips-md/)

Dr. Kara Mia Stratton at Novant Mint Hill OB GYN in Charlotte, North Carolina performed my laparoscpic bilateral sapligectomy. I am 24, not married and no children. Dr. Stratton said she had no issues performimg sterilization on anyone over 21 who has been properly counselled. During the councelling session she just explained to me that the procedure (bisalp) is permanent, cant be reversed and that the only way I could have my own kids after would be to go through IVF. I signed a consent form and that was it.

[Dr Savannah Pena](https://www.novanthealth.org/pf/providers/1750812434/savannah-pena/about-me) with Novant Health in Charlotte, NC. Bisalp. I went to the Midtown office, zero bingoes throughout the whole experience. Just confirmed I didn't want kids and kept rolling. It was my first time visiting her when I was approved.

+1 Dr Pena, I didn't even realize she was on the list of doctors. I saw her for the first time in Sept after my other doctor retired. We were discussing my periods and I mentioned how bad they are and I've tried everything without any luck. She asked me if I have kids or want them and I told her no. She told me I could have a hysterectomy, if I'm interested in going that route. I never had to ask or beg. She listens when her patients express their concerns about their health and she explains everything in great detail so you don't leave confused or unsure of what's going on. I HIGHLY recommend her.

+1 Dr. Pena. Feb 2023. Bisalp on 30-year-old redditor. I wasn't hit with any bingoes, and the only questions they had were just to confirm that I didn't ever want to become pregnant and that I understood the bisalp is permanent. At no point did I feel judged or invalidated. Dr. Pena laid out my options, and thoroughly answered my questions and concerns about the procedure. I was approved without fuss and had my bisalp about a month after the initial appointment.

Dr. Ingrid Bullard in Charlotte, North Carolina has done bisalps for sterilization. She agreed to do my Bisalp for sterilization with no push back whatsoever. She’s wonderful and she really cares about women’s right to choose.

[Dr. Samuel Ivan](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-samuel-ivan-yvj53cr519). I got my vasectomy when I was 24M, have no kids, have been single for seven years, and they gave almost no push back when going in. This was in Charlotte, NC.

Dr. Ganem at Urology Specialists of the Carolinas, vasectomy age 28, single, no kids. My experience was great. He didn’t try to talk me out of it, but he did inform me that “hey you know this is permanent, right?” Once I told him that I have never had any desire for children, he didn’t say anything further to dissuade me. The procedure was a breeze, three little “bee stings” of lidocaine and then less than 10 minutes of procedure. Very little pain, and we chatted the whole time. I would certainly recommend him for a vasectomy.

**Clemmons** 

[Doctor William Walter Crone in Clemmons North Carolina](https://www.wakehealth.edu/providers/c/william-walter-crone#nav-topics). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 28 years old, never married but with partner of two years, I have never wanted nor had children. I expressed my need to get this done and gave my reasons, all he asked was if I was sure because this would be permanent, and I assured him I knew and this is what I wanted. He agreed to do it and his team called me the SAME DAY to set up an appointment for surgery. I went in a week ahead of time to sign all paperwork and get my instructions for the day of. Doctor Crone had no hesitation to do this for me when I had been denied by two previous doctors. Total cost of surgery was around $29,000 but my insurance covered $27,000.

**Concord**

[Dr. Kimberly Newman](https://www.carolinashealthcare.org/provider-profile/kimberly-newman-1477574721/?phonenumber=844-235-6997) Allowed a 19 year old to get the Paragard and was excellent during the procedure. Permitted same person, now aged 22, to get a tubal ligation. Very understanding doctor with a great attitude and someone who is genuinely happy to improve her patient's well being! Highly recommended her for anyone looking in Charlotte/Concord area. 

-1 Dr Newman - another user looking for sterilization was bingoed and not taken seriously. 

+1 Dr Newman - approved sterilization (bisalp or tubal, depending on what insurance will cover) on me yesterday. I am 22, single, and nulliparous. She only asked if I was certain, aware that it was permanent, and that other options exist. She approved me with no further questions or comments after I answered "yes" to all three questions. She told me that most young people who want sterilization almost always know from a young age that they don't want children and that she's never had a patient regret it. She was very understanding of my stance and didn't bingo me once.

+1 Dr. Newman. March  2023. Bisalp on 22-year-old redditor. She and her team were great from start to finish. They made me feel so comfortable throughout the entire process, made sure that I understood everything that was going on, and they didn't bingo me a bit. They even got an IV specialist to place mine so I wouldn't get stuck multiple times.

**Durham**

[Dr. Jason R. Rothman, MD](http://www.triangleurologync.com) Vasectomy for 26yo; Asked a few questions about life goals but nothing about regrets, changing minds, etc. Scheduled procedure within a week after initial consult appointment. He said he had done procedure for a 21yo, but wants patients to come in to consult appointment fully informed.

[Henry N. Pleasant Jr., MD](https://www.dukehealth.org/) -  "Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 25 year old female with autism spectrum disorder after 2 GYN appointments and psychiatrist approval. This doctor was very respectful and I highly recommend him for pursuing any form of childfree friendly GYN care. I was never belittled or bingoed by the doctors or the staff at Duke Health GYN. I highly recommend Duke Benign Gynecology at North Duke Street, Durham, NC for childfree friendly GYN care. Team and psychiatrist at Duke Autism Center, Durham, NC was also childfree friendly care provider."

-1 Dr Pleasant -  another member (21, unmarried, childfree) advises that Dr Pleasant "refused to provide any sterilisation procedure" and tried to push an IUD. 

[Amber Jarvis](https://www.dukehealth.org/find-doctors-physicians/amber-m-jarvis-md). 31F/no kids/long term partner. Went for 1st visit (normal annual exam). I brought up that I wanted permanent BC and had for many years, and that I was nervous of being shot down. No bingo, other than general discussion of the process and risks. She proactively mentioned bilateral salpingectomy as the preferred and most effective method. Said she'd have the front office call me to go over insurance and schedule the procedure, and that was that.

[Dr. Amy Broach](https://www.dukehealth.org/find-doctors-physicians/amy-broach-md-ms). 33 year old, female, engaged, childfree. She believes in a woman's right to bodily autonomy. The only thing she will do, is give you a run-down of what to expect after surgery and will ask you if you are sure this is what you want to do, and then give you the info to schedule your surgery. I discussed with her the issues that many women experience when it comes to seeking ligation/salpingectomy, and she confirmed that women have the right to do with their body what they want and she will not try to stop someone from getting sterilized. Also, for those looking to getting a procedure done soon, to call and ask for a "surgery consult" so that you can get on her calendar earlier. I highly recommend her.

**Fayetteville**

[Dr. Alan "Shay" Davis](https://www.fwc.net/profile/alan-shay-davis/) Performed laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on 26 year old patient, when I tried to explain my reasons he stopped me to say that I know myself more than he does and he has no problem with it if it's what I want. He's an excellent OBGYN and gave me an IUD years ago as well. 

+1 Dr Davis - bisalp on 25F patient with no children. Simple and to the point. No extra questions asked outside of the medically necessary questions. I drove from Durham so he asked me how I found him. I mentioned this lovely list and he seemed indifferent. He is very educated and experienced with what he does. 

**Fort Bragg** 

[Dr. Rachael Guame at Womack Army Medical Center](https://womack.tricare.mil/Health-Services/Womens-Health-Pregnancy) performed a bilateral salpingectomy on an early 30 year old married childfree patient. The patient was a dependent of the active duty service member with no prior requests for sterilization. The patient did not meet Dr. Gaume until the day of surgery, instead the patient met with other doctors (residents) for approval and pre-op. The patients spouse was deployed the time of all appointments/surgery and his consent was not requested though they asked if he felt about it and if he had considered a vasectomy instead. However, this Doctor works at a military hospital and can only treat individuals with TriCare Prime Insurance and who have been referred by thier PCP. This Doctor is currently located at Fort Bragg, NC.

-1 Dr Grewal, nurse made remarks about how I will not be getting my tubes tied. I ended up doing an IUD instead. The pain was terrible. 

[Dr. Kelly Fogleman](https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/kelly-fogleman/) OBGYN; Gave lots of BC options. Was hesitant to approve bilateral salp for childfree woman under 26 (patient was 25 at time of request) but ultimately approved surgery.

Was not hesitant, and went through all of the options and risks.

[Dr Melissa Davies, Eagle Obstetrics, Greensboro, North Carolina](https://www.eaglemds.com/physicians-and-providers/melissa-davies-do/), Bilateral Salpingectomy, Childfree female, 33.

Surgery performed March 2023. Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC covers preventative procedures at 100%.

[Dr. Kelley Haven](https://www.greenvillewc.com/physicians/Kelley-Haven-MD) laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on 28 year old female. Dr. Haven was AMAZING. I went in prepared with printed research and a written acknowledgement of my understanding of the procedure, and she was impressed. She expressed frustration over the lack of access to this procedure for women who want it and stated she believed in women's autonomy of their bodies in all forms. She said the only thing that's important to her is that I'm fully informed of the procedure medically and I'm making this decision of my own free will. She asked why I wanted it and I said I have never wanted kids, had been firm in my decision for over 10 years, and she said that's great. She knows I'm under 30, unmarried with no kids and stated that those factors had no relevance for her. No counseling requirement or waiting period. She fit me in for the procedure within a week so I could have it done while I was on leave from work. Super child-free friendly and amazing bedside manner.

[Dr. Jonathon M Firnhaber](https://family-medicine.ecu.edu/jonathon-firnhaber/). Vasectomy. 21, in a relationship (not married), childfree. Was super friendly and good at the job, made me feel very comfortable and safe. Medical school so he did have some residents at the procedure as well so I don't think it was weird. Took my insurance (Tricare). No bingos, but did ask why I wanted the procedure at the consultation (likely because of my age). Little wait time, consultation to the appointment was about a month.

**Goldsboro** 

Dr. Lori Spisak at the Wayne women's clinic in goldsboro, nc. Went in, asked for a bisalp and was scheduled less than 30 days later.

[Dr. Brianna Whittemore MD](https://www.womenshealthcarenc.com/meet-our-staff) Women’s Healthcare Associates, 245 Memorial Drive, Jacksonville, NC 28546, (910) 353-4333. Body-positive doctor: Bisalp on 350 lb 26-year-old patient without pushback, May 2023. She's very big on supporting women's bodily autonomy. She hates the patriarchal view of women needing a man (doctor or boyfriend/husband/etc) choosing for her if she is able to get pregnant or not. I asked her during my pre-op appointment if my belly would increase the risks of the surgery, and she said yes, but she wouldn't have approved me if she wasn't comfortable doing it. She has anesthesia separately approve me because of my weight and having to breathe for me, and they approved me very quickly as well, pretty much just had me open my mouth to she them my throat lol She also said she always does a full bisalp and removes the tubes.

**Mooresville**

[Dr. Nicole Wellbaum] (https://piedmonthealthcare.com/provider/wellbaum-nicole-s-md/) Lake Norman Ob-Gyn (704-663-1282)
Performed a salpingectomy on a 21F in December, 2018. I originally asked about tubal ligation for sterilization, but Dr. Wellbaum recommended a salpingectomy for its additional benefits once she knew I wanted to be permanently sterilized. I was never once asked if I had a partner, let alone what they thought about it. Dr Wellbaum's only concern is that I was of legal age (21 in the US). I was only asked once if I was sure, the morning of the procedure. When I responded yes, she smiled back at me. Dr. Wellbaum has also agreed to perform a total hysterectomy on me at a later time--the later date is due to my personal schedule, not any concerns on my age.
Possibly important: I have been seeing Dr. Wellbaum since I was a teenager, and she's know for many years I've never wanted children. Highly recommended for Charlotte/Concord/Mooresville/Troutman area! She is absolutely worth the drive for wonderful medical care. 

+1 Dr Wellbaum - I scheduled the consultation in November, went in December, and she approved me that day. I didn’t even need a binder. She brought up regret among young people because she’s required to but also she could tell that I’ve done a lot of research. She didn’t question my decision one bit. The surgery was originally scheduled for January but then she got sick with COVID the day before. She personally called me to let me know and thankfully she recovered quickly and had a mild case. Then it got rescheduled for today. Just a heads up for getting sterilized in covid times: if you get sick, then your chances of dying during surgery go way up so you have to wait 4-6 weeks at this office. If you’re vaccinated then bring your vaccine card. This morning she was amazing and super nice, as well as the rest of her team. Again, she was very excited to see me and expressed how sad she was that she couldn’t do the surgery last month. 10/10 recommend her.

+1 Dr Wellbaum performed bisalp on 23-year-old woman without bingoes and without difficulty.

+1 Dr. Wellbaum performed partial hysterectomy on approx. 32-year-old woman with severe period cramps and endometriosis, who had been turned down by a number of other doctors.

[Dr. Nicole D'Andrea](https://carteretobgyn.com/meet-the-doctors/doctor-nicole-m-dandrea/). She isn't childfree but agreed to my bilateral salpingectomy with minimal questioning. Very kind and informative too. This was in 2017 and I was 26. I am a 21 F and she first gave me a pamphlet for an IUD BC and had me come back in a month. I had to tell her all the reasons why this BC and BC in general was not right for me, as well as to tell her why I did not want children. Dr D'Andrea has since sterilised this patient. 

[Dr. Olivia McCallum](https://carteretobgyn.com/) at Carteret OB-Gyn associates in Morehead, North Carolina. Preformed a laparoscopic tubal ligation on a single 20 year old childfree person. She generally prefers her patients to be 21 to be sterlized, but commonly makes exceptions. There were no bingos at all. Dr. McCallum is also very lgbt+ friendly and her most common exceptions on the 21+ preference are for FtM trans men.

-1 Dr McCallum who refused bilateral salpingectomy for a 22F citing her "maternal instincts not letting her", offering a tubal ligation instead.  

[Dr. Shelli Garret-Albaugh](https://carteretobgyn.com) Bilateral Salpingectomy, 22F, engaged. As soon as Dr. Garret sat with me in the office she asked if I felt the same way as I had the week prior, and once I said yes she went into the details and got me the card for the scheduler to get a hold of me to schedule the Bilateral Salpingectomy. No bingos, no judging, just quick and professional.

[Dr. Brian Brimmage](https://www.raleighob.com/meet-our-providers/brian-c-brimmage-md/) of Raleigh OBGYN Center in Raleigh, NC. Specializes in minimally-invasive procedures. Performed bilateral salpingectomy for 28yo CF. I was seeing another provider for birth control but I wanted to be sterilized. She wasn't an MD so I called the main office line and asked for a referral. Receptionist recommended Dr. Brimmage so I scheduled a consultation. When I met with him, he asked me one time if I was absolutely sure I didn't want "more kids" (more, lol). He never asked if I had children already. He never asked if I was married or any questions about having a partner at all. I confirmed I wanted a bi-salp, after researching my permanent sterilization options and risks. He booked me for the procedure, performed it with zero issues, and that was that.

[Dr. Lee Ann Roberts](https://www.robertsgyn.com/) 5816 Creedmore Road, suite 209, Raleigh NC 27612. (919) 881-7766.Tubal ligation for 28 year old woman, with no bingoes. NB Dr Roberts will be retiring at the end of 2021. 

[Dr. John Marks](http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-john-marks-xvhsf) GYN (not an OB), very supportive of long-term contraceptives and sterilization - He no longer does surgery he will however get some colleagues to do a tubal

[Dr. Charles Monteith] (http://www.bestvasectomy.com/) (Minimally invasive vasectomy). 100% recommend Dr. Monteith. Vasectomy on a 26-year-old male with no kids. The procedure took 15 minutes maximum. Dr. Monteith explained every step (making jokes throughout to make the procedure less stressful), AND didn't even require a consultation visit prior to the vasectomy. He offers a consult+vasectomy at the same appointment as an option if you are sure you want the vasectomy. No bingos. He asked "So, you have no kids and don't want any?" We said "Nope, none for us". He said "Well, this is a great decision for you to make then! Do you have any questions about the procedure?" Also, he does scalpel-free vasectomy and everything heals super quickly. Minimal soreness. Didn't even need to take ibuprofen after. Highly recommend.

[Dr. Rosemarie Newman](http://wakewomenshealth.com/our-gynecologists/) Requirements: 21+, approval from a mental health professional. NB this doctor will be retiring within the next two years - while this shouldn't deter our members from seeking care with this doctor, it is worth taking into consideration for those people looking for a doctor to offer them healthcare in the long term.

[Dr Claire Sellers](https://capitalareaobgyn.com/), Bi-salp, 32, married, no children. Super supportive, no bingos or issues at all. Said "I believe women should do what they want with their bodies so let's get you scheduled".

+1 Dr Sellers, Am 26F, no kids, not married. Zero bingos, super friendly and supportive of a woman's right to choose what to do with her body. Had initial consult as a new patient, pre-op, and surgery all completed within one month's time.

+1 Dr Sellers, I'm 25F, unmarried and childfree. She never bingoed me, heard me out and although mentioned alternative non-permanent birth control methods and the possibility of regret was also quick to approve and schedule me. She did an amazing job, got most of the gas out and has my upmost respect. Received a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy.

+1 Dr Sellers, 32yo. She was so calm and reassuring the whole time and had no issues operating on a younger woman. She also said any of her colleagues at the practice would perform the procedure.

[Dr Richardson](https://capitalareaobgyn.com/contact/) at the same practice as Dr Sellers above, 32, single (non married and not dating/no partner), no kids & never been pregnant. I contacted Capital Area OBGYN to request Dr. Claire Sellers, she was out on maternity leave at that time lol. At my consult with Dr. Richardson, we talked through all other contraception methods, she explained that there are inherent risks with any surgery and that it was permanent. She said it was clear I had my mind made up/was sure and "didn't want anyone to be forced to have kids if they don't want to" (re: NC's recent 12 week abortion ban). She reiterated that it was a good time to get the procedure as it is covered in full under ACA, "and we don't know if that will change in the future". Scheduled for 2 months out but could’ve done 3 weeks out, pre op appt and surgery itself went great.

Prashanti Aryal - She performed my bisalp yesterday. I'm 35. I had been talking about it with her since October '22. In December she scheduled me for the 1/30/23 surgery. She and the team did a fantastic job. My incisions are small, I'm feeling great (so far).

Dr. Jodi Bailey at Triangle Premier Women’s Health (https://trianglepwh.com) just outside of Raleigh, NC for doing Bilateral Salpingectomy. I’m a single 27F who has been adamantly childfree from a young age, went in to Dr. Bailey’s office and said that I’ve never wanted kids and that I wanted a tubal ligation. She said immediately that it was no problem and warned that she ONLY does bilateral salpingectomy, she does not do tubal ligations by any other method or procedure. I told her I was fine with that. She said she had no issues doing it for me because I’ve been an adult for a decade and if at 27, I didn’t want kids, that it was fine to do a bisalp. HOWEVER, and I stress this, she said “it would be a different story if you were like 21” so it seems like she will most likely turn down anyone who is between 18-21, and is probably more likely to do this for people who are maybe 25+

**Wilmington**

[Dr. Joshua Vogel](https://www.wilmingtonhealth.com/providers/joshua-vogel/). Tubal ligation w/ cauterization, 25F, unmarried with no children. Extremely friendly to the operation from the get go, particularly when I brought up the impending risk of Roe v. Wade being overturned and my fear of pregnancy, saying "I don't blame you, pregnancy is scary." Initial discussion was a phone consultation during which we went over non-permanent alternatives and he emphasized that this is a permanent procedure with a risk of regret. This was prefaced however that these were facets of the surgery he simply needed to cover and that he was not intending to be paternalistic, as this was ultimately my body. Dr. Vogel worked with me to ensure that my insurance would cover it. I was also able to keep in my hormonal IUD for the purposes of preventing menstruation. I was scheduled for both my pre-op appointment and surgery before the end of the month. Overall a wonderful experience from both him and his staff, and one nurse even positively commented on how much more common this was becoming. Can't recommend highly enough.

[Dr. Gregory Woodfill](https://www.wilmingtonhealth.com/providers/gregory-woodfill/) - I had a bisalp (full tubal removal!). Only had to ask once and it was scheduled. Age 36. No medical issues or chronic illness. Only issue was the office and pre op nurse did not quite fully prepare me for the length of recovery. Overall he is a kind, understanding, highly professional doctor, highly recommend l!

[Dr. David Kraebber] (https://www.wilmingtonhealth.com/profile/david-m.-kraebber) Vasectomy - 29 yo, single

[Dr. Lee Ann Garner] (https://www.nhrmc.org/physician-group/physician-directory/g/garner-lee-ann) Bilateral Salpingectomy - 28yo, single. Best Dr I've ever had! No bingos, did offer IUD option, but was open to my conviction that bisalp was best for me. Very supportive, went to bat for me when another Dr. was being difficult. One consult, and surgery was scheduled for 3 weeks out, but was rescheduled due to COVID-19. Her office was straightforward and extremely flexible and supportive given the scheduling complications. Super considerate, reassuring, and kind, great bedside manner, excellent surgeon. She even re-used a previous scar so I wouldn't have more scars on my tummy! A model for other physicians to follow. 

[Dr. Joshua Vogel](https://www.wilmingtonhealth.com/providers/joshua-vogel/). Bisalp @ 33. No bingos, no BS. First discussion he gave me literature for an IUD just so I knew my options, but didn't express any reservations about the procedure. Last pre-op discussion, he touched briefly on regret in an "I'm just doing my job" manner. One of the nurses commented (in a non-condescending way) I was their second childfree sterilization of the day, and it seemed to be becoming more common. Another just went "their body, their choice". So great people all around.

[Jennifer b. Calfee - Glen Mead ObGyn](https://www.nhrmc.org/physician-directory/c/calfee-jennifer) -  During my consult 2 months ago. She Listened to my concerns over abortion becoming less accessible, and did not bingo me, I was emotional and cried and she respected my emotions and did not use them against me. She showed concern for my family medical history around endometrium cancer, and wanted to wait until she had my records to proceed so she could make sure to have all i needed done. I was approved last week for a Bilateral salpingectomy with no push back. And she noted that as long as I'm sure she respects all reasoning. I am 22years old. With no children

** Winston Salem** 

[Dr. Stacee Goodrich](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-stacee-goodrich-2h8c7) was very professional and did not bingo me regarding my tubal ligation. She just asked that I was 1000% sure I didn't want kids. I said yes and we went right to it. Very kind. She followed up with me about after-care when I came to from the anesthesia. She does work both with Lyndhurst and Forsyth Medical Center.

**Bismarck**

[Dr. Kristen Gray, OBGYN] (https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/kristin-gray), Sanford Health, 414 N. 7th St. Bismarck, North Dakota 58501, 701-323-5870. Performed hysterectomy on 20-year-old CF woman. “I have been dealing with debilitating periods ever since they started.I had to write a letter of understanding, that I understood the permanence and what it would look like for me to have kids if I changed my mind. I provided her with research I had done on my own. I also had to wait 6 months for her and the hospital staff to feel comfortable with doing this for a 20 year old.” Also in Minot.

[Dr. Christie Iverson] (http://www.sanfordhealth.org/find-a-doctor/christie_iverson) Tubal ligation. Asked me if I understood it was permanent and that it'd be easier for my partner to have a vasectomy. Didn't give any pushback, just took medical history and brief explanation of procedure before making appointment (30/f).

[Dr. Michelle Tincher](http://www.sanfordhealth.org/find-a-doctor/michelle-tincher) IUD. Discussed potential risks and benefits and helped find the best option for me. Helped me talk to my insurance company. Very pleasant and understanding.

[Dr. Kimber Boyko](http://www.sanfordhealth.org/find-a-doctor/kimber-boyko) Vasectomy at age 25. Very nice and friendly. Nursing staff was very nice as well.

[Dr. Karim Chourtemanche](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/karim-courtemanche) Vasectomy at age 33. Staff was very friendly. Dr. Courtemanche asked some routine questions to make sure I understood that this was permanent and that I was of sound mind. Never got push back from him. The procedure was quick.

[Dr. Rachel Peterson MD] (https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/rachel-peterson) Bilateral salpingectomy on 28F. I needed a referral from Primary Dr. But after that smooth sailing; about a month wait from referral to surgery.

+1 Dr. Peterson. Nov. 2022. Bisalp on 29-yo redditor. I live in a pretty conservative state so I didn't expect my doctor to offer to remove my tubes. I went in originally thinking I would ask for the longest lasting IUD since I didn't want kids and my doctor was so quick to say she can remove my tubes if I truly don't want kids. No referral needed.

**Dickinson**

[Dr. Erica Hofland](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/erica-hofland) - Tubal ligation at 33, not married. Asked if my partner was willing to have a vasectomy and then scheduled surgery.

**Fargo**

Dr. Joyoti Saha, working in the Fargo/Moorhead metropolitan area of North Dakota and Minnesota, USA, performed a bilateral salpingectomy for me with very little BINGOs, the consult took maybe half an hour. She said multiple times that she was simply making sure I understood the permanence of the procedure, and that she was willing to do it even though I'm only 24 and have no children. The procedure was performed this past Thursday for me.

[Dr. Jordan Coauette](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/jordan-coauette) (Essure, Laparoscopic Hysterectomy) Performed at Broadway Hospital on 21F. Willing to do on sound of mind and body patients. No hoops to jump through, however North Dakota requires multiple signed documents stating they did offer different options. 

[Dr. Stuart Topley, MD](https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/stuart-topley/)(Vasectomy) Had the Vasectomy at the West Acres Essentia clinic. During the consult he only asked If I had kids, and If I did not want kids. No bingos at all which surprised me, Single and 28. During the consult I asked him the youngest age he would do one and he said his youngest was 22, but usually he would do them 25+ with no concerns. Procedure was very easy, no complications.

[Dr. Jason Myrmoe](http://www.sanfordhealth.org/find-a-doctor/jason-myrmoe) Vasectomy at age 26. He and his nurse just made sure I understood the risks/rewards and were very friendly and funny!

[Jennifer Janke APRN, CNM](https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/jennifer-janke/)(Contraception/Referral for Sterilization) Might seem odd, since she specializes in Midwifery, but she was the first available when I made an appt to get on BC (at 24 IIRC). I had decided on Depo, she recommended an IUD if I was thinking long term, and we eventually went that route. When my Mirena was nearing it's end, I mentioned I'd like a salpingectomy, and she immediately referred me to an OBGYN (Dr. Strang) who could perform the surgery. The exam rooms are rather baby-centric, and have plenty of infant photos, so if that's a problem she's not your pick, but she was very accepting of my desire to not have children, and very open about the pros and cons of various forms of contraception, and IMO very easy to talk to.

[Dr. Angela Strang, MD](https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/angela-strang/)(Salpingectomy) I was able to book a consultation regarding my salpingectomy within a week of getting my referral, and we merely confirmed that I was healthy enough for the procedure, that I was sure about my choice, and she gave me a brief overview of how it would go. FTR I was 30 at the time, so I don't know if age was a factor. She was willing to book me for the surgery at her next available opening (2 weeks out) but I opted for a later date. Day of surgery had to sign a few forms and such, but the surgical team was awesome and even sent me a thank you card afterwards. BCBSND covered the surgery 100%, I only paid a small amount <$100 for pre-surgery pregnancy test, kind of annoying but if I had to pee in a cup to get sterilized so be it.

+1 Dr Strang. Robotic Laproscopic Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingectomy (Took the cervix, uterus, and both fallopian tubes, but left both ovaries). 29 at request, 30 at procedure, less than 2 months apart. Married for 5 and we've both been CF for over 15 years. Dr. Strang is a gem. Great bedside manner, and she actively listens to what you're saying. She only asked 2 questions "How long have you felt this way" and "Is your partner in agreement". I asked for sterilization 10/7/2021 and had my surgery 11/29/2021. I have BCBSMN, and they approved my pre-auth after an ultrasound and an endometrial biopsy to screen for cancer. But I don't know what the final charges will be as I had already hit my deductible, but not quite my OOPM and it was just today.

Dr. Jedidiah Perkerewicz, MD did a bisalp on me (24F). Had one office consultation, no bingos, hardly needed to touch my binder. We had a chat about the alternatives (which I think might be legally required here?) but when I expressed that I was confident and had been since I was 8, questions ceased and he was getting me scheduled for surgery. I did have to book out a few months in advance. It was so much easier than I was expecting it to be, and Dr. Jed (he calls himself that) was a wonderful experience.

[Dr. Michaela Heller](https://www.essentiahealth.org/find-doctor-provider/profile/michaela-heller/) of Essentia Health in Fargo, North Dakota. Perfromed a Bilateral Salpingectomy I was referred to her by my GP when I mentioned that I was ready  to seek sterilizaiton.  I am AFAB-Non-binary, 28, unmarried and childless. She did not even look at my binder during my consult for the bisalp. She simply warned me that it was irreversible and I would never be able to naturally get pregnant. But, she also added that in the end it would be my decision to make, not hers and that she would do the procedure if that was what I really wanted. She removed my IUD and treated me for endometriosis (that I didn't know I had!) while I was under during my bisalp surgery. She and the surgial team treated me with the utmost respect throughout the process and I recieved no bingoes. Overall it was a great experience.

Performed a salpingectomy on me as a 23 year old. Only one consult was needed and I had to sign some papers required by the state. She did inform me of risks such as regret but never tried to talk me out of it and was wonderful! Highly recommend.

[Dr. Pierre Barbot in Grand Forks, ND](https://www.altru.org/find-a-provider/pierre-a-barbot-md/). He was very accepting of my choice and actually offered me a hysterectomy instead of a bisalp! He didn’t bingo me at all through the entire process; I definitely recommend him.

[Dr. Diane Bigham](https://www.trinityhealth.org/providers/diane-bigham/) Vasectomy for a 31 year old with no kids and in a long-term relationship. She made sure it was understood the procedure is permanent and replied, "smart!" when told we had "no kids and want to keep it that way." Provided a prescription for 1 anti-anxiety pill to take prior to procedure. For the procedure, one small incision was made, large portions of both of the vas deferens were removed, and the ends were cauterized. A few stitches were put in and they fell out on their own after a few days. Semen sample was checked 3 months after procedure and the all-clear was given!

+1 Dr Wexler, He was amazing. Listened to what I had to say. And went over the 3 different procedures of sterilization and the risks. After he finished and asked if I had any more questions I thanked him for listening to me and told him I’ve been bingoed (did not use that word) at my last gyno and that was why I left.

Bisalp on 24-year-old redditor, Oct. 2022. Dr. is body-positive and gender-friendly. She did not question, shame, doubt, or impede my decision in any way. And she even accommodated my request for an all female surgical team because of my anxiety as a sexual assault survivor. She listened. She absolutely made everything as easy, smooth, and comfortable both emotionally and physically as humanly possible. And most of all she provided support. She continuously reminded me when I tried to explain why I wanted it the surgery that she didn't I didn't have to nor did she need me to justify my decision beyond I don't want kids. I had the birth control implant in and she made sure to mention that we did not have to remove it and that I did not have to stop taking hormonal birth control if I didn't want to.

[Summa Women's Health Center](http://www.summahealth.org/medicalservices/womens/gettinghelp/womenshealthcenter) All of the doctors I've had (psychiatric,bariatric and gynecological) have all been accepting and helpful. I've interacted with Dr. Mark Pozgay (Bariatric surgery), Dr. Jennifer Duncan (Bariatric office psychologist), and resident Dr. Megan Cesta (OB/GYN). . There was no judgement for never having had a pap at 30 or pursuing sterilization. Answered all my questions as well. Excellent hospital system.

+1 Summa - [Dr Clemons](https://physicians.summahealth.org/provider/Jessica+D+Clemons/1161675) (Summa Women's Health Centre). I (single 24F) had my bisalp with Dr. Clemons. I asked for the procedure in early May and had it done by mid June. She told me, “I can’t tell you what you want from your own life.” I’ve had zero bingos from any staff during my appointments. Amazing experience!

+1 Summa - [Dr Clemons](https://physicians.summahealth.org/provider/Jessica+D+Clemons/1161675) Asked about sterilization on my first visit with her, and she gave me consent paperwork to sign within 15 minutes. Due to covid, surgery got delayed, but she gave me consent paperwork at age 24, ended up being performed a year later at 25.

+1 Summa -  Dr Clemons. She is at Summa Akron, Medina and Barberton. I met her as a new patient (old gyno gave me lots of bingos and I couldn’t take it anymore) in the Medina location and had surgery in the Barberton location. 32 married F, approved me for sterilization. Called end of June and got in end of July and she approved me for bilateral salpingectomy and changing out my IUD so I could continue to have periods. She listened to my concerns about how our state is vying to make birth control not an option. Did discuss hysterectomy but I did not have enough menstrual issues to be a good candidate for that so we did bisalp with IUD. Gave me paperwork within 10 minutes. Had procedure done 8/30/22 and as requested entire Fallopian tubes gone. She even provided me with scope photos to prove. Summa staff were by far the friendliest when I called around to get in for this consult. No judgement for my age or what I was requesting. All Summa staff at Barberton hospital were respectful and no bingos for pre admit testing or the actual procedure. Highly recommend.

+1 Summa - Dr Clemons  was absolutely wonderful. I (23F, not married) was a new patient and had no bingos. Told her I was looking to have a bisalp and she briefly explained other contraceptive methods, thoroughly described what to expect for the bisalp, and verified I was sure about my decision. The same day at my first appointment we started scheduling the procedure (earliest available appointment was about one month out from the initial consultation). No bingos from any other staff members at the Summa Barberton Hospital.

+1 Summa - Dr. Mendise, not a single question about why I wanted the surgery; other people I talked with were also happy with him. Procedure was great and no bingos from a single person, from my regular gyno to preop testing to anyone I saw the day of surgery. Very, very satisfied.

+1 Summa - Dr Mendise, approved a 21yo for sterilisation. "Dr Mendise didn’t even think twice about approving me and said that it is the patient’s decision and that he would not stand in the way of that"

+1 Summa - Dr Mendise, my friend (23F, never married, always has been childfree) got a bisalp yesterday from Dr. Thomas Mendise of the Summa Women's Health Center, Ohio. She said she wanted a bisalp. He touched briefly on the types of sterilization methods that exist and alternatives to sterilization. She said she wanted a bisalp in particular and he said that he will schedule the surgery. He gave her no resistance about her desire for sterilization. The doctor and all the nurses at both the Summa Health center and hospital were kind and empathetic, and she was never faced with a single bingo.

+1 Summa - Dr Mendise was amazing! He actually approved me for the bilat at 20 years old (which is the youngest ive seen so far in the list) and simply scheduled me to actually get it just after my 21st birthday in order for insurance to cover it. Absolutely no bingos, made it very clear it was my choice and no one elses. On the day of surgery, everyone in the operating room was very nice and comforting! Surgery only lasted 35 minutes and I was already home in a few hours!

[Dr Neel Parekh](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/23506-neel-parekh) Vasectomy, 25yo, made sure we knew it was permanent. 

[Dr Brian Canterbury](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/21936-brian-canterbury), I had a vasectomy done. Age 24. Married. No children. Wait time: About a month from first appointment to the surgery. With insurance, it costed about $1000 but my deductible was met with half of that payment. He was very understanding. He made sure I wanted the surgery and understood that it is hard to undo the procedure, but did not give me a hard time at all.

[Dr. David Biats, M.D., OB/Gyn](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24363-david-biats) - Tubal ligation. (330) 344-8565

[Dr. Naveen Arora, M.D., Urology](https://physicians.summahealth.org/provider/Naveen+K+Arora/1057792) - (No-scalpel vasectomy). 330-374-1255. Did my vasectomy at 21, made sure I understood it was permanent and that I didn't want kids, did not bingo me. Very polite and professional, procedure was performed well and I recovered with no complications or side effects.

[Dr Cecila Ellis, ObGyn Associates of Akron](https://obgynofakron.com/about-us/cecilia-ellis-do.php). Bilateral Salpingectomy - 26 yo (25 at time of approval), single, childfree. My referring PA from ObGyn Associates of Akron set me up with a consultation appointment when I asked about a bisalp during my annual exam. The office staff gave me all the codes to run through insurance prior to the consultation. During my consultation, I did not feel like I got bingos, although Dr Ellis did run some "considerations" past me and asked me twice if I'd be willing to try an IUD first. However she answered all of my questions and concerns and was very confident in her abilities

[Dr. Heather Mihalik](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/29568-heather-mihalik), 1 Akron General Avenue Akron, OH 44307, 330.344.8565. Bilateral Salpingectomy. A/S: 22 [AFAB] (21 at time of procedure) - Nonbinary. Extremely kind and understanding person! No bingos, but went through the legal spiel of understanding that it is permanent, risks, and option for IUD. Quick in and out initial consultation and scheduled for surgery a few months out due to scheduling. Surgery went INSANELY smooth, and healed quickly.

**Athens**

[Dr. Kathleen M. Bertuna DO] (https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1160/Kathleen-M-Bertuna-DO) 26 E Park Dr Ste 105C Athens, OH 45701 P: (740) 331-6912. Dr. Bertuna provided an outstanding surgical experience for tubal ligation to a 28-year-old woman, with no argument or pushback.

+1 Dr Bertuna, bisalp 27yo. My experience was excellent; no questions about my decision to not have kids, just a fantastic practitioner who does her best to make sure that her patients have all relevant information. It's worth mentioning that she does prefer that childfree sterilization candidates be at least 25 years old. Martial status never even entered the conversation. I signed the consent form and got scheduled the same day I asked. The procedure was as smooth as can be; I've had a really easy time recovering.

[Dr. Timothy Kermode DO](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1376705616/Timothy-T-Kermode-DO) 75 Hospital Dr Ste 260
Athens, OH 45701 (740) 594-8819 (also in Logan). April 2023. Hysterectomy on 23-year-old CF redditor. AMAZING experience. No bingos, and we only had to jump through a few hoops for my insurance to cover the procedure. I did get the procedure for other reasons as well, but when I first visited Dr. Kermode he was more than willing to discuss other sterilization procedures even with no underlying issues. He actually had a one on one with the insurance company when they started giving me a hard time to push through payment for the procedure. Often used phrases such as “It’s your body and your choice, I am just here to support you.“


**Beavercreek** 

[Steven Crawford, MD](http://www.ketteringphysiciannetwork.org/practicedoc.cfm?DID=43&p=1&npi=1386603611). Dr. Crawford did a partial hysterectomy (all but ovaries) for me (f/28/single) in February of 2022. He ensured I was certain I did not want children on two separate occasions and had me sign sterilization acknowledgment forms after the pre-op visit. He is a fantastic and responsive doctor, and I could not speak more highly. As a healthcare provider myself, I am confident to send others to him and know he will offer high quality care.

**Bellefontaine**

[Dr. Kristina Caine, MD](https://www.maryrutan.org/provider-directory/providers/dr-kristina-caine/), 937-599-3538. Bilateral Salpingectomy I'm 21, single, no kids, just graduated college. I came in for the consultation ready to argue my way to this surgery but was happily met with "I trust you, your mind, and your heart" and "I'm not in the way to your life choices." The only warnings she gave me was the risks of the surgery and anesthesia. She made sure I knew my options were discussed prior but didn't try to convince me of any. Dr. Caine was even aware enough to ask if this procedure needed to be hidden from anyone (ex, parents, etc) and if I had a partner if they knew. She shared the statistic of regret, but even joked "Call me in 15 years regretting and I'll fax you this consent form and the cost of IVF." It was an amazing experience with her and I was surprised to find someone so willing in my part of Ohio.

**Bryan** 

Dr. Bazzi. The address for the practice is 434 W High St, Bryan Ohio. Phone number is 419-633-0755. I got my tubes tied. I'm 25 years old and I'm married. But I think they would've done the procedure whether I was married or not. They asked me once or twice if I was sure about the procedure but I didn't feel like they were giving me a guilt trip. Overall, good experience and would recommend to any woman looking to get her tubes tied.

**Centerville** 

[Dr. Misty Dickerson](https://ketteringphysiciannetwork.org/practicedoc.cfm?DID=667&p=181&npi=1427296318&vt=1003). Zero Bingos. Never had to explain my reasons or defend it. Bilateral salpingectomy two weeks ago. Takes insurance with a team to fight ins to approve it. 35F. We are as yet unsure if this gyno will work with younger patients. 

[Dr. Jennifer Mittlestead at Far Hills obgyn in Centerville, Ohio](http://farhillsobgyn.com/). Performed a vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy on me, age 25. I’m married to a woman and do not have any children. I was a previously established patient and I had the surgery done about 6 weeks after I first discussed it with my doctor. The office did a great job working with my insurance. I didn’t receive any bingo type comments from anyone in the office.

[Dr. Caroline Peterson, DO Progressive Women's Healthcare Centerville, Ohio](https://www.progressivewomenshealthcare.com/). I went in today and asked about doing a tubal. Dr. Peterson asked me two questions: "Have you had kids before?" and "You're 120% sure you don't want kids?" but mostly in a I have to ask these questions just to make sure kind of way. She then told me stories of other women who had come in ready to fight and she was like "it's your body, your life. who I am to say no?" I told her my only concern was my periods being really bad again and she said "well let's do an ablation too then." We talked about what it would be like and got me scheduled for a surgery in June. Only thing that wasn't awesome is that she's the only doctor at the practice (there are two NPs) so if she has to go deliver a baby (like she did this morning), you have to wait. I waited maybe 45 minutes in a room before she came by. It really wasn't that bad though.

**Cincinnati**

[For Women practice](https://www.trihealth.com/hospitals-and-practices/for-women) - The doctor referring the procedure was Sara Rinala and the Dr who did the procedure was Heather Barhorst. Both are located in the For Women practice (https://www.trihealth.com/hospitals-and-practices/for-women) I had a bilateral salpingectomy performed. I'm 29F, child free in a long term relationship, not married. Both doctors were incredibly supportive. When discussing the procedure they never guilted me about not having children. When discussing cons/ complications, all were relevant medical concerns and not feelings. Scheduling was pretty easy, I had an annual exam with Dr Rinala, who referred me to Dr Barhorst. I met with her for a pre op to discuss the surgery and recovery and then scheduled my surgery about one month out. Dr Barhorst answered all my questions and made sure I had appropriate pain control and medications for my recovery.

Laura Van Wyck, DO (The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, OH), permanent contraception 21+

[Dr. David B. Schwartz](https://cincinnatiobgyn.com/about-us/) - while we haven't had a testimonial based recommendation for this gynecologist, this article suggests he is childfree friendly: https://foxbaltimore.com/news/nation-world/doctor-sees-10-fold-increase-in-women-wanting-to-remove-fallopian-tubes-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-abortion-rights.

Samantha Sinclair, MD, FACOG Christ Hospital Obstetrics & Gynecology 513-985-9966 1955 Dixie Hwy suite C Ft Wright Kentucky 41011. 8989 Winton road Cincinnati Ohio 45231. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am an ob gyn in the Cincinnati/Northern KY area. I am personally childfree but also believe in bodily autonomy. I would love to be added to the list as I routinely hear from patients their difficulty obtaining contraception and even permanent sterilization in our area. I perform bilateral salpingectomy, cautery and Filshie clip tubal ligations, in addition to all topical Gynecologic surgeries (D&C, dx scope, hysterectomy). My practice accepts most instances including Medicaid" 21+ 

Dr Jane Morris, University of Cincinnati, this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I’m an Ob/Gyn in Cincinnati, OH who’s happy to do sterilizations on AFAB people who are CF!" 21+ only. Takes Medicaid. 

[Nima R. Patel, MD](https://directory.trihealthpho.com/provider/Nima+R.+Patel/942204) - this doctor is unconfirmed, use with caution and send a modmail if successful with achieving sterilisation. 

[Dr. Betsy LeRoy](https://directory.trihealthpho.com/provider/Elizabeth+LeRoy/775581). I'm 25, absolutely childfree forever now (whoo!), and unmarried. I've been on the birth control since I was 16 & have always been satisfied with it. I actually brought up sterilization as a joke in December 2021 because my yearly checkup was right after Dobbs v. Jackson, and I knew it was only a matter of time until Roe v. Wade was overturned. I made a joke about wanting to be sterilized, but would settle for an IUD (instead of my current BC) because it was the next best thing, & soon I wasn't going to have a backup plan. Dr. LeRoy turned around, looked me dead in the face, & said she would schedule with me that day for a sterilization if that is what I wanted. Well I did, & here I am sterilized! She could have gotten me in much sooner, like in Feb 2020, 2 months after the request, but MY schedule was too full. Dr. LeRoy knows I am in a long-term, committed relationship with a man and did not ask me once what my partners thoughts were. She asked if I was sure at our pre-op appointment & when I said yes did not ask again. 

+1 [Dr Leroy in Cincinnati, Ohio](https://directory.trihealthpho.com/provider/Elizabeth+LeRoy/775581#provider-details-experience). Bisalp, performed in November 2022. 25, in a polyamorous marriage, 100% childfree. Dr. Leroy is incredible. The very first time I saw her she asked me to tell her a little about myself, and I felt totally comfortable immediately, even telling her I'm polyamorous, and she didn't even bat an eye. No bingos, and when I told her about a horrible experience with another doctor she apologized. Bisalps are her go-to sterilization procedure. She told me the wait times were a bit longer because of demand following the Dobbs decision. My wait was 9 weeks from appointment one to surgery, with a required pre-op about 2 weeks before surgery.

[Dr. Elizabeth Ruchhoft, MD, OBGYN](https://www.thechristhospital.com/physician-details?Provider=C21Q0VFDN3) The Christ Hospital Physicians, 513-936-5294. Sterilized 28yo CF without questions. 11140 Montgomery Rd. Suite 2400, Cincinnati, OH, 45249, 513-936-5294. Also in Fort Wright, KY. 

[Dr. Israel Washington, M.D.] (https://www.thechristhospital.com/physician-details?Provider=C21Q0VFKI4) - Performed tubal ligation for me at 27, unmarried with no children. Spoke about how he used to turn down women for surgery who weren't married or didn't have children yet, but that he changed his views after realizing a woman should be free to make her own bodily choices, which was a nice thought. He did preach a bit about how I should remember that "as long as I have a uterus I can have a baby someday if I want" but otherwise went ahead with no pushback. No one in his practice judged or bingoed me and I was treated with respect. I signed a consent form, had to wait 30 days, and then I scheduled the surgery which was paid for in full with my Kentucky insurance.

[Elizabeth Venard, M.D.](https://womenshealthcenters.com/providers/elizabeth-venard-md/)  (513) 481-4777
Performed bilateral salpingectomy for a 25 year old female, unmarried with no kids.  Overall, pleasent experince, and she listened to my rationals. One thing noted however, at the PeriOp appointment, Dr. Venard did make a comment how she "Cringed at performing this operation on someone so young". On my surgery day, I was informed by the Stand Alone OR's registration, (Trihealth Surgery Center West) that by October 1st, 2020 billing would go through Good Samaeritan Hospital. Due to this, they would be unable to bill for sterilization anymore since they would not be considered a stand alone anymore and Good Sam does not perform sterilization due to religious objections. Dr. Venard is still open to performing the operation though. 

[Dr. Anita Weisberger, M.D.](https://www.thechristhospital.com/physician-details?Provider=D2V40JSN09) Scheduled my Bilateral Salpingectomy, stated that her job is to care for patients, not try to control their lives. Answered every question I had and showed no signs of judgement! Commended me on the thought and research I’ve given to the choice. In addition, she is also an amazing Gyno that I’ve used for the last 6 years. 
Cons are that she is booked out pretty solidly, but she’s worth it. 

[Dr. Brian Miller, M.D.] (http://uchealth.com/physician/brian-miller/) (Tubal Ligation) Dr. Brian Miller himself is not the most childfree, however the NP within his practice, Cynthia Dehlinger, most certainly is!

[Dr. Michael B. Rousseau, M.D.](http://urologygroup.com/meet-the-urology-group/michael-rousseau/) - (Vasectomy)  He was very friendly and while he recommended taking time to consider if it's what you truly want, he has no problem with performing vasectomies on childfree people.

Nanci J. Billock, MD, 375 Dixmyth Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45220 - performed tubal ligation on 24 year old. Email: nanci_billock@trihealth.com

[Dr. Eric O. Haaff, M.D.](http://urologygroup.com/meet-the-urology-group/eric-haaff/) (Vasectomy) Very nice guy who went out of his way to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. He's done the procedure over 4000 times and recommends young men who want sterilization to stop by The Urology Group.

[Dr. Lisa Gennari, M.D] (http://aiwhcincinnati.com/) (IUD's, Essure, Tubal) I've been at here since I was 15 and love all of them. Went to her about Essure and no questions were asked (28 yrs old). Explained the procedure, let me know about a tubal and only asked why I picked one over the other, she gave me a date of the procdure and  said they would let me know a time based on what was open that day. 

+1 Dr. Gennari - (bilateral salpingectomy). I (26) was also approved without question on my first visit to her. About half an hour before the surgery (after I was suited up with IV and monitors) to say hello, ask if I had preference on pain medicine, and to tell me that they might have a way to do the surgery with only one incision (they did). After the surgery, on a Saturday evening, she was happy to talk to me about medicine advice, which shows that she is dedicated to her patients. 

+1 Dr. Gennari - Dr. Gennari is my queen. I (24f, childfree, unmarried) have been a patient at her office for 8+ years and have seen her specifically for about 4. During my annual gyno appointment I told her I wanted a bisalp. As I rattled off a list of reasons why I wanted the surgery, she practically stopped me midsentence to say "you don't have to convince me of anything, this is your own personal decision." I was booked a week later for my surgery (which went exceptionally well) and am currently 4 days in recovery. Dr. Gennari is passionate about advocating against shady health insurances who are finding loopholes to not cover bisalps. She openly stated that if my insurance were to only cover specific types of tubal lugation, she would find a way to make sure my bisalp was honored during surgery. Thankfully Aetna covered bisalps (I only have to pay my $500 deductible) and I had no trouble with that aspect. I felt well informed, cared for, respected, and heard throughout my entire sterilization journey with Dr. Gennari.

[Dr. Amberly L. Davidson, through the Bethesda North Minimally Invasive Surgery Center](https://directory.trihealthpho.com/provider/Amberly+L.+Davidson/775399), performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on me today, at 29 years old, unmarried, without children. I can’t recommend her, her staff, and the affiliated hospital and their staff enough. It’s a majority female team, not a single bingo came from everyone, my doctor took absolutely no convincing (she said my age was a factor there though), and everyone was professional and empathetic.

+1 Dr. Davidson Feb. 2023. Bisalp on 34-year-old CF redditor. Dr. Davidson and her team were amazing, helped me explore all the options available to me in my desire for birth control and permanent sterilization. I never felt pressured in a particular direction, and she reminded me that she was there to help provide information and the best medical care for me, not judge or influence my decision. We settled on a bisalp with no fuss. Her team did an amazing job addressing my concerns and helping me feel comfortable the day of surgery. I am currently about one week post-op and would highly recommend her!

[Dr. Priya Gursahaney](https://www.uchealth.com/en/provider-profiles/gursahaney-priya-1427372184), MD / UC Health Network - bilateral salpingectomy. I (26, unmarried & no children) was given the green light almost immediately. She was very supportive of doing what I wanted to do with my body and she was extremely friendly and informative through the whole process. Will follow up after the surgery! +1 Approved 23 year old for bisalp.

+1 Dr Priya Gursahaney, UC Health, Cincinnati, Ohio. 38F, married, performed bisalp July 2022. Dr. Priya gave absolutely no pushback on my request for a bisalp. I had the binder with me and she said it was completely unnecessary. Didn’t ask marital status until after she booked my surgery date asking if I had someone to stay with me after surgery. Replaced my IUD during surgery as well to eliminate periods and save me the pain of removal/placement.

[Dr. Caroline Palmer, MD](https://www.cgha.com/doctors/caroline-palmer-md) - tubal ligation. Use caution if under 40, as this doctor has advised she would be "reluctant" to sterilise anyone under 40. 

[Dr Benjamin River](https://www.urologygroup.com/physician/benjamin-e-niver/) Vasectomy - 25 M Single with Girlfriend No Kids.

[Dr. Eric Kuhn, MD](https://www.urologygroup.com/physician/eric-kuhn/). Vasectomy 27M, single, no children. The consultation and procedure both went very smoothly. Didn't even bat an eye at my age/childfree status.

**Cleveland** 

[Dr Marc Snelson](https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/snelson-marc-1568575017). He works in University Hospital network from 3 different locations near Cleveland, OH. He was very kind, respectful, and even funny. I’m 30, single, and no kids and he didn’t give me any push back or question my reasoning for wanting the procedure. I HIGHLY recommend him. 

[Christopher S. Reese, M.D] Urology Partners LLC - http://www.urologypartners.net/ - Met with Doctor Reese once when I was 27. He asked me if I wanted kids. I said no and we scheduled my Vasectomy for a couple months later. Procedure went well. Overall a great experience from start to finish.

[Dr.  Donald Bodner, M.D. - University Hospitals] (https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/bodner-donald-1578597175) - Vasectomy when I was 32. He asked me how many kids I had (zero), if I understood the procedure was permanent, and scheduled surgery for 1 month later. Very understanding, no bingos.

[Strongsville Family Health Center](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/locations/strongsville-fhsc) (Vasectomy)
I was 31 with no kids, Dr. Rabets and the nurse were very respectful of my choices. No bingos. 

+1 Dr Rabets - A 20 year old user got a vasectomy consultation in October 2017. EDIT: I have since been informed that Dr. Rabets no longer works for this location, but I would still give them a chance.

[Shirley Bennett, OB/GYN at Southwest General](https://www.swgeneral.com/Physician-Directory/B/Shirley-L-Bennett-MD.aspx) tubal ligation.

[Dr. Patrick Isaac, DO ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/26803-patrick-isaac). Primary Location: Cleveland Clinic Strongsville Family Health Center. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Unfortunately this doctor is leaving this practice and his new location is somewhere in Michigan. His replacement is NOT childfree friendly from our member's advice. 

+1 Dr. Isaac. Bisalp on 21-year old redditor, Oct, 2022.

[Sybil S. Sailofsky, MD](https://www.metrohealth.org/physician/sybil-sailofsky-181164) - She approved my bilateral salpingectomy at age 26. She understood my concerns about Roe vs. Wade and didn't give me any pushback except telling me she was required to tell me that regret was one of the risks of the procedure. MetroHealth system has a very generous charity care program. Check their financial assistance website. Your procedure might be free, insurance or no if you live in/near CLE. I was insured but not working at the time and it was totally free.

+1 Dr Sybil Sailofsky at Metro Health in Cleveland OH. I found her on the childfree friendly list, and found her very lovely, pleasant and professional. I was 30 at consult time and had tried different methods of birth control prior, so she was very comfortable taking my request seriously. 

Dr Linda-Dalal Shiber out of Metrohealth in Cleveland, OH. I (28F, unmarried no previous pregnancies) asked about sterilization at my first appointment with her and she was immediately receptive. She was required to explain all contraceptive options and the rate of regret among those under 30 (hospital policy) but did not give me any actual bingos or hint of judgement. It was more of a “I have to tell you this” convo. Did not ask about or need to speak with my partner at all, other than just letting me know that vasectomy is easier to recover from. She was willing to schedule surgery in the next 3 weeks from my first appointment AND even suggested bi-salp as her preferred method before I had to bring it up.

[Errol O. Singh M.D., F.A.C.S.]( https://capitalurology.com/) 4885 Olentangy River Rd., Columbus, OH 43214, 614-784-8765. Vasectomy on 22-year-old redditor. I asked one of his assistants if I was likely to be denied based on my age before my consultation. He told me he has never seen the Dr deny someone on the basis of age.

[Vidhya Krishnan, MD. OBGYN]( https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/vidhya-krishnan-md-90312), Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, 543 Taylor Ave. Suite 3044 Columbus, OH 43203, 614-293-3069. Bisalp on 23-year-old redditor. Dr. Krishnan agreed to do a bisalp after just the consult, no hoops to jump through at all. "She was wonderful, really! I went in with my list of talking points, and she literally stopped me and said "You don't have to convince me to do this for you. You want it done, and I can do it, so I'm going to do it for you." Doctor provides gender-affirming care according to website, and is very LGBTQ+ friendly.

[Dr. Valerie Busick Avina Womens Care Columbus OH](https://avinawomenscare.com/providers/valerie-busick-m-d/). Had a patient in for a bisalp consult and she questioned why my name isn’t on the Reddit list. I didn’t know it existed but have done several surgeries for child free patients without question or judgement. I do discuss birth control alternatives and risk of regret in surgical consent process but ultimately believe it’s the patient’s right to choose what is right for their body.

Dr Michelle Crawford in Columbus OH performed my bisalp yesterday without giving me the slightest fight over it. When I had my consultation I was all prepared for having to argue my case and she just asked “ok so you know this is permanent and if you want to get pregnant after you’ll need IVF right?” And I said yes and she immediately got me scheduled. Even managed to coordinate it with another necessary surgery I was having so I could have them both done simultaneously. 34F

Dr Boothman, OBGYN with Professionals for Women’s Health in Columbus (pwhealth.com). This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I’d love to be added to the list of people who will do sterilizations, no matter if/how many kids/previous pregnancies someone has."

+1 Dr Boothman,  I'm a 23f with no children and was sterilized Sept 2022. I had a few appointments to discuss my options and have blood work done. At no point did she question or judge me and said yes immediately when I told her I wanted my tubes removed. My first couple of appointments were in early July and then another closer to the date for surgery blood work. She had an amazing attitude from start to finish and really made me feel cared for. Any worries or anxieties I had she took very seriously and helped me find ways to mitigate my stress. She even took before and after pictures and sent them home with me so I wouldn't be paranoid about them still being in my body. I had a minor complication post surgery that she handled quickly (popped stitch that my body was mad at but no infection or anything). She even supported my Anti-Baby Shower even though she couldn't go. I wasn't bingoed once and she even mentioned a vasectomy to my partner when he was there to help me handle my blood draw.

Dr Elizabeth Orwick, from Avina womens center in Columbus Ohio. I'd been seeing her for some time for standard women's care, but after the leak about overturning Roe v Wade, I decided to ask her for a tubal + ablation. She told me that all she wanted to hear was that I never want children and we were set to get everything scheduled. She gave me the option to leave the tubes, just cauterized, or to remove them completely. I opted to have them totally removed. The tubal/ablation was completed and I'm recovering nicely, with no complications.

Dr Jessica Miller in Columbus, Ohio performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me. I’m 25, not married, no kids, etc. I mentioned a family history of breast cancer and mental illness during the initial appointment. She agreed to take them out during the first appointment and I had them removed a month later.

[John Teteris](https://avinawomenscare.com/locations/westerville-executive-campus-dr/) I got a bisalp as a 22 year old single childfree woman. It took about 5 weeks between the consultation and the actual sterilization. When I got in the office with Dr. Teteris, I told him I wanted to get sterilized and he gave me a short talk about how it is my decision and he won’t try to sway me from it in some paternalistic way and he wanted to make sure it wasn’t a decision I regretted. He then just asked me if I had any questions about the procedure and approved me for the bisalp with no hesitation.

[Dr. Steven Balaloski](https://www.womankindhealth.com/). Procedure completed: bilateral salpingectomy 31F, Married, CF, both myself and 32M partner are now sterilized. Overall, my experience was good. It took a while to get the surgery schedule and I had to follow up with the office a couple of times but once the surgery was scheduled it was just a matter of going to the necessary appointments before the surgery date. No bingos from staff or Dr. Balaloski. He was very upfront and factual and only asked if I understood that what I was doing was permanent, to which I said I can't wait to be sterilized.

[Dr. Katherine Rivlin](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/katherine-rivlin-md-70990) Scheduled for a bilateral salpingectomy as 34F. Despite what you read on the linked site, she doesn't currently practice obstetrics (so a baby-free waiting room!), and her bio says it all: "I specialize in abnormal uterine bleeding, contraceptive care, early pregnancy management, family planning, preventative care and transgender health. I am passionate about partnering with my patients in order to create healthcare plans that are both evidence-based and suited to their unique needs and values." She is exceptionally compassionate and I cannot recommend her highly enough. In fact, she was the one who brought up sterilization once it was clear that I am serious about not procreating.

[Dr. Brienne Williford](https://cwc4women.com/about-us/brienne-williford-md/)-  at age 27 had a salpingectomy. She did have to go through the whole "this is permanent, sometimes people change their minds, there's no going back", but in the end agreed to the procedure. 

+1 Dr. Williford granted my wish for bilateral salpingectomy with no pushback. I’m 30F and child free; she simply made sure that I knew it was permanent and gave me no flack. Was never bingoed by any of her staff either. Awesome attitude and wonderful doctor. Columbus, OH.

[Dr. Amber Murphy Mack](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1212/Amber-Mack) (Bilateral Salpingectomy) - At the age of 33, I was able to get a bi salp without any bingos or pushback. I had an appointment for an annual exam and discussed sterilization options. She was able to schedule my surgery two weeks later. As a new patient, I was also able to schedule an appointment relatively quickly with the office (less than a week after I called). She is very friendly and has great bedside manner. I would recommend her as a doctor. She was especially understanding of my concerns with Ohio’s heartbeat bill.

[Dr. Brett L. Worly ](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/brett-worly-md-50255) Bilateral salpingectomy on 24F. He is also willing to do tubal ligation or clips. I asked about permanent sterilization and he agreed to proceed immediately. Explained risks of surgery in a way that was simply stating facts to ensure I was fully educated. No bingos. He’s a little awkward in general, but wonderfully kind. Always makes sure you are comfortable and supports your care in the way you want it done.

[Dr. Britta Buchenroth] (https://www.eastwindwomenshealth.com/physicians.html#buchenroth) Offered tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy to 26F right when I told her I wanted to be sterilized. She did not ask me my reasons for being CF, imply I would change my mind/regret it, nor ask me about my partner. Explained both procedures she offers and the risks and recovery time for each. Verified my bisalp will be done within a month. Very friendly and charismatic doctor. I highly recommend her.

[Dr Shayne Rheaume](www.eastwindwomenshealth.com), in practice with Dr Buchenroth. This gynecologist has reached out to advise, "both of us are very happy/willing to offer any type of birth control and sterilization based only on what the patients would like. We also take most forms of insurance and Medicaid as well."

[Dr. Eric J Springer](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/eric-springer-1055200)
I was able to schedule a vasectomy with Dr. Springer at the age of 21. I told him that I talked over it alot with my significant other (long term relationship) and thought it would be the best option since we both don't want children and a vasectomy doesn't cause the nasty effects that female birth control such as the pill, or the IUD may cause to women. He told me that he would advise against it since I was so young and had no children, but he also said it was my decision to have it done. He explained the procedure and the risk thoroughly. 

[Dr. Stephanie Conway](https://www.northwestobgyn.net/physicians/)
At 38 I requested a tubal ligation and they suggested a bilateral salpingectomy instead, because of cancer risks related to tubals. I received no pushback, and my surgery was scheduled 2 weeks later. Actual surgery was done at Riverside Hospital's Same Day Surgery Center by Dr. Conway but all staff there were equally friendly, and I even got a fist bump on the way out from my childfree after care nurse.

+1 Dr. Conway. 2023. Bisalp on 24-year-old CF redditor. Doctor did not doubt my choice at all, and unlike my previous physician, did not think my history of anxiety had anything to do with my ability to make choices for myself. 

[Dr. Allison Murphy](http://www.acoog-obgyn.com/murphy.php) sterilised a 22 year old via bilateral salpingectomy. NB this patient had failed IUDs and a heritable autoimmune disease as justifications however feels that Dr Murphy would have still sterilised her if her only reason was that she didn't want kids. 

[Dr Adam Weiser](https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/adam-weiser-aee2ba04-5289-4773-a291-179465c78e6f-overview) traditional vasectomy on unmarried 21 year old. Only critique was that he was a bit "rough with your stuff" but was professional and did not bingo. 

[Dr. Shivkamini Somasundaram (everyone calls her Dr. Mini)](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1645/Shivkamini-Somasundaram-MD), who I traveled out of state to see. Performed hysterectomy with endometriosis excision on 24F. She is very empathetic and trauma-informed which was very helpful for me. She never made me go through a pelvic exam prior to surgery, she told me she would only do so after I was anesthetized and she kept her promise. Very kind and compassionate, believes everyone should have the right to their own bodies. Originally scheduled for a bisalp, but when I arrived the week of surgery I was able to meet with her and got it changed to hyster within 48hrs of the surgery and she was totally willing. Did require a note from my psychiatrist confirming that I've always felt this way, which was easy for me in particular as I'd been seeing the same one since I was 17, but important to keep in mind.

[Kayla R. Busuito, DO](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1952842486/Kayla-R-Busuito-DO). April 2023. Doctor can be both misogynistic and bigoted with respect to mental health issues. Approach with care, if at all.

Tubal ligation I, 30F with no kids, got approved for sterilization immediately the first time I saw her. She wanted to do a bisalp, but in the end we went with tubal ligation because that was 100% covered with insurance while the bisalp was only covered after my very high deductible. She was incredibly respectful of my choices, very nice and professional, and I had my surgery done within 5 weeks of my first meeting with her. Her surgical scheduler was amazing dealing with my insurance company.

-1 Dr. Busuito. 2023. Doctor saw me 4 times, each time she kept acting as if she would schedule me to get my sterilization done but kept pushing the pre op appointment. Finally she told me because I have a history of anxiety she wouldn't do the surgery on me because she felt I was too high risk for regret despite me telling her I have a therapist I had been seeing for 5 years that fully supported my choice to get sterilized and even wrote a recommendation letter but the doctor still refused. I told her I would continue searching for another doctor and she still said she didn't feel I should get it done. So she wasted hundreds of dollars for appointments I didn't need just to deny me because I have a history of anxiety. I don't feel like she is truly an advocate for a woman having the right to choose what happens to her body. She also repeatedly asked how my partner felt about the surgery and what if I change my mind.. (I found a doctor the following month and got the surgery so +1 for Stephanie Conway for doing it without doubting my choice at all even though I was 24 years old and child free)

[Dr. Anita Somani](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1255387635/Anita-P-Somani-MD). She completed a total hysterectomy(uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix). 22 in a relationship, don’t want children ever. I had a short wait time to see Dr. Somani, but she accepts insurance and through my own everything was free. I came to her to see if she’d be willing to perform a hysterectomy on me despite being young and she said yes and even offered a tubal if insurance didn’t cover the hysterectomy. Only asked why I was making the decision now but did not sway me to wait or turn me down.

[Dr. Erin May](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1124332002/Erin-C-May-MD), I just had my bi-salp with Dr. Erin May last week. I am 27F and in a long-term relationship. She was so kind and open to the conversation. She talked to me about the differences in ligation versus removal. She kept all conversations medically relevant, except that she did acknowledge Ohio is not a “friendly state” to unwanted pregnancies. She approved me in March and I had surgery six weeks later in early May.

**Dayton**

[Dr. Shannon McAfee](https://farhillsobgyn.com/), 937-435-6222. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "happy to provide sterilization services for women who wish to remain child free! If you need an appointment and have any issues getting scheduled, let me know and I’ll be happy to work you in!"

[Dr. Michael K. Yu, M.D.](http://www.miamivalleyhospital.org/physician.aspx?phid=26028)

[Dr. Samantha Houser, DO](http://farhillsobgyn.com/drHouser.cfm) - I am 30 and got a bilateral saplingectomy with zero questions asked. Dr. Houser is so kind. 

+1 Dr. Houser - she's warm, kind, funny, and agreed to bisalp me, no questions asked  Consultation consisted of her explaining the surgery and that it's permanent and not reversible, I agreed that that's what I'm going for, the end.  

[Dr. Mark Monsour, M.D.] (Vasectomy) Very straight forward and practical. $650 Total. No insurance. 22M. No Problems. One incision. No Kids. 

[Dr. Blake Anderson] (vasectomy) 25M. No fuss, just explained the procedure and asked if I was sure. $700 and insurance covered 20/80. No scalpal vasectomy.  Good bedside manner. Same location as Mark Monsour and from what I understand, all the doctors in Dayton Physicians are good and won't give much pushback. Did get a bit bingo'd by a nurse but they're not associated with any particular doctor.

[Dr. Susan Emmerling] Friend went in for a tubal (early 20s F) ready to fight for it, Dr. Emmerling surprised her by agreeing immediately.  I (37F) went to her as a result when seeking a new doc, and she helped me to decided between a tubal and a hysterectomy (since I have fibroids for days).  I mentioned to her why I chose her, and she said, paraphrased "I'm not going to tell someone what to do with their body.  If they know what they want it's not my place to argue".  Great bedside manner, spent time talking with me and not rushing me out of her office like some docs seem to.  She's got offices in Huber Heights, Beavercreek, and Englewood.  

+1 Dr Emmerling,  I’ve been seeing her for years and she’s amazing, prioritizing the patient’s desires unless they’re medically contraindicated. 

**Delaware**

[Dr. Hariklia Louvakis, M.D.](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1677/Hariklia-Louvakis) (Bilateral Salpingectomy) Dr. Louvakis was incredibly professional and respectful of my decision to be sterilized at the age of 26 and was able to get my surgery scheduled very quickly. I definitely recommend her! 

+1 Dr Louvakis, Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy 25F, no kids or history of pregnancies. Dr. Louvakis said she had to bring up the “regret study” but since I was 25, she considered me capable of making my own decisions and agreed to the surgery. She also pointed out all of the people in the study who did not regret their decision. No other bingos. She said 25 is when she starts performing bisalps (no tubals).

**Dover** 

[Dr. Chelliah - male OBGYN](https://g.co/kgs/1Lq19D). I am 24 going on 25. I have never had children. Been married for 2 months. Together total for 7years. Dr. Chelliah asked why I wanted sterilized if my husband was getting a vasectomy. I said that no matter what I did not want children, with or without him. He did not ask about an IUD or Nexplanon. I have been on BC pills since 17. He made it clear that is was permanent as he only performs Salpingectomies, not Tubal Ligations. You do need a full pelvic exam before approval and be over the age of 21 (I am unsure if this is hospital policy as it is with Union Hospital under Cleveland Clinic). Once you have your 2nd appointment which is a pre-op to sign paperwork you are scheduled for surgery. Dr. Chelliah is also very nice and welcoming. I have only ever been to a female OBGYN before him. He and his staff made it clear they cared more about my decision than me being able to produce. He did inform me of the possibility of regret as he should and also followed it up with "the risk does go down after 30, but has no bearing on whether or not you have had children so I am not worried about that". My husband did attend my appointment and he was welcomed back with no questions. This was my first ever appointment with Dr. Chelliah and for asking to be sterilized.

[Dr. Zemis - Male](https://g.co/kgs/Uz3EDM). My husband is 22, no children. We have been together 7 years married 2 months. This was his first appointment asking for a Vasectomy. He was asked a grand total of maybe 4 questions. The first thing he wanted to know is if he was married. He is unsure of this would have bearing on your approval rate but it was the first question he asked. He asked how I (his wife) felt about children, if he wanted children in the future and if he already had children. He got scheduled same day 1 month out. He did come in knowing all side effects of the surgery and the doctor did note in his official notes that my husband was well dressed. This doctor does put you under for the surgery so you will need a full day off work.

**Elyria**

[Dr. Douglas Sherlock](https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Sherlock-Douglas-1194078717). Westshore Women's Health and Midwifery, 125 E Broad St, Elyria, OH 44035, 440-529-2473. Procedure done : hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 35 and in a long term relationship we are both child free. No bingoes at all. Super chill doctor really listens to your concerns. Called me the day after my surgery to check on how I was doing.

+1 Dr. Sherlock, performed bisalp on 24NB, single, no kids. No bingoes, very informative about options and willing to push for your needs. Everyone I came into contact with was super nice and helpful during the procedure.

+1 Dr. Sherlock. Jan 2023. Hysterectomy and bisalp on 30-year-old redditor. He didn't give me the run-around; I experienced no pushback. He reassured me by saying that this is a decision made between the patient and the doctor and that I should ignore societal pressures when making my decision. First saw him Nov 9, had pre-op MRI Nov 30, had follow-up post-MRI Dec 21, and had my procedure Jan 20.

[Dr Elizabeth Clark](https://directory.trihealthpho.com/provider/Elizabeth+A.+Clark/775364?_ga=2.180966436.209978379.1658599152-460636078.1658599152) at For Women Tri-Health offered no pushback in scheduling and performing my tubal ligation, aside from explaining the risks and asking if I'm 100% sure. When I called to make the consultation appointment, the nurse and scheduler were doubtful that it'd be approved, but their doubts were completely unfounded. This is in Evendale, OH [Cincinnati area]. I'm 26 years old, unmarried, and have no children.

**Gahana/Grove City**

[Dr. David Jones, D.O.](http://moca-obgyns.com/practice-northeast/physicians/bio-48.html) (Bilateral Salpingectomy, Tubal Ligation, IUD placement, Essure) Dr. Jones was very professional and caring towards all of his patients. While our opinions differed on the topic of sterilization young (25F), his number 1 priority is patient care and he agreed to do it for me if it was 100% what I wanted. He even gave a referral for a doctor to perform a vasectomy on my husband and offered to talk with my husband about any questions he may have about both male and female sterilization. 

**Holland**

Doctors Nancy Arquette and Elizabeth Read in Holland, Ohio. 22 year old female sterilized with a fallope band tubal ligation.

**Huber Heights**

[Dr. Amy Park](http://www.cobgyndayton.com/) Gave me a tubal at 27, no argument. First doctor I went to, spoke for maybe 5 minutes before she told me to schedule the surgery with the front desk. Asked if I'd considered IUDs, Essure, etc. Only issue I had was pushing for "cut and burn" vs. the clips - I absolutely didn't want the clips and she made it happen. Great doctor.

**Independence**

[Dr. Erin Higgins OBGYN](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/23264-erin-higgins) 5001 Rockside Road, Independence, OH, 44131, 216-986-4000. Doctor requested to be added to the CF-friendly doctors wiki. She performs tubal sterilization procedures.

**Lakewood**

[Jonathan Seibert](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24789-jonathan-seibert) Cleveland Clinic Women's Center 1450 Belle Ave, Lakewood, OH. Procedure approved: bi-salp Experience: Dr. Seibert was short and curt throughout the visit but did not bingo. He told me it was my body, my choice. He stated twice that it was permanent, went over risks twice, and told me regret is the number one complaint but that he "won't lose sleep over it if I do regret it." Overall a great experience from both him and the other staff! *Dr Siebert is leaving the practice at the end of 2023* 

+1 Dr Seibert, I just saw him today for my bisalp consult, and I think his bedside manner is great. He’s personable, has a good sense of humor, and I felt respected when I spoke to him about why I was there. He’s just matter of fact, but did express how he respects a woman’s choice because all facts are covered in the conversation and all risks are discussed as well as the fact it’s a permanent and irreversible solution.

+1 Dr Siebert, completed bilateral salpingectomy. 22F, unmarried, no children. I was referred to Dr. Seibert by Dr. Patrick Isaac for my procedure as he left the Cleveland Clinic. Also gave names of Dr. Melanie Katz, and Huda Afaneh to see for the procedure but I did not see either of these providers. The latter two doctors are currently unconfirmed. 

**Liberty Township**

[Dr. Jenny Demos-Bertrand, DO, OBGYN](https://www.thechristhospital.com/physician-details?Provider=K4D60U2ZX3) The Christ Hospital Physicians, 6939 Cox Rd, Suite 350 Liberty Township, OH, 513-585-0140. Doctor’s statement: “I’m an obgyn who practices in Liberty Township, Ohio, in the northern Cincinnati area. I will do salpingectomies (a form of surgical sterilization) on anyone who wants one. It requires an office visit where we discuss the surgery and sign consents. The patient will then get scheduled for surgery. I do not have limits on age or how many children they have, even if it’s zero children. I’m also happy to place Nexplanons or IUDs.” Note: do NOT accept appts with Dr. Teresa Schutte, she is not childfree friendly, and confirm with reception that you are booked in with Dr Demos-Bertrand prior to attending your appointment. 

+1 Bisalp on 22-year-old woman, without bingos. "We had one consultation appointment where she just went over what the surgery would be like, then surgery was scheduled for about 2 months later. She didn’t ask why I wanted a bisalp." Staff at hospital were very kind.

**Mansfield** 

[Dr. Michael Subit](https://www.ohiohealth.com/find-a-doctor/profile/1619196037/Michael-J-Subit-MD). Procedure: bilateral salpingectomy w/ uterine ablation My info: 29yo, single/never married, no children Mentioned wanting to get sterilized at the annual appointment and didn't receive an ounce of pushback or even an "are you sure?" No bingos, just a great doctor who listens to his patients. I mentioned wanting to eliminate my periods, and received no pushback in regards to getting an ablation either. Ohio has a 30 day waiting period, and had surgery 6 weeks after the initial appointment.

**Martin Ferry** 

[Dr Kara O'Karma](https://www.eohospital.com/doctors/2TR3uFF7jpC2NRXd8GFml2) - Tubal ligation. 24 Female at time of procedure, single (No mention of partner at consult appointment)/. Very professional. Did ask my reasonings for wanting to get sterilized at young age. Only mentioned IUD once, and after explaining previous complications subject was dropped. Very fast turnaround time, went in for consult for Tubal Ligation and walked out with surgery date. No bingo's given. No mention of partner or lack thereof at any appointments. Does accept Ohio medical insurance. All staff at hospital at time of surgery very kind and understanding. Explain everything very clear and kindly as well.

**Marysville** 

[Neil Niemi, M.D.](https://avinawomenscare.com/providers/neil-niemi-m-d/). I’m 24, no children, not married. I originally had an appointment with another provider (in the same practice) from this list, but she was scheduled pretty far out. I ended up having a gynecological problem and had to schedule an appointment with a different provider in the practice for an earlier date. On a whim I inquired about sterilization during this appointment, he asked a few questions, but agreed to do it with little to no push back. He was informative, but not pushy.

**Mason**

[Dr. Amy Brenner, M.D.](http://dramybrenner.com/)(IUD's, Essure, Tubal Ligation, Bilateral Saplingectomy) I got a tubal at 24 without any argument. Everyone at this clinic is very kind and respectful and they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

+1 Dr Brenner. I got essure done at 27 with no argument. Asked my reason for getting the procedure done and then moved onto the next initial consultation question. No push back from the staff at all. Staff was respectful and very nice!

Tina Pearson MSN, CNM at Seven Hills Women's Health Center together with Dr. Aichholz, MD (second doctor required to approve procedure). Approved bi-salp on 21 y.o., performed ca. 6 months later (OP was 22 at that point). No bingos, no hardships. Note: OP was already going to the practice for ~6 years as regular OBGyn, so patient history might play a role.

[Dr Rachel Haas](https://www.promedica.org/provider/rachel-haas-do-obstetrics?utm_campaign=reputation-management&utm_segment=gmb_listing-link&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic-search). I am a 27 year old female with no kids or medical issues, I just don’t want to conceive children naturally. I explained it to her after discussing other birth control options and that I was nervous to bring up a tubal litigation after knowing other doctors reactions. She responded that I am an adult who is capable of knowing what is best for myself and she would do the procedure. Knowing about the subreddit, today was my pre-op appointment and I had asked her questions for other women, she said as long as they are 18 and insurance approves it she would do the procedure. Some insurances require them to be 21 others 18, and explained if anyone did want children down the line IVF is still an option if someone has had a bilateral tubal litigation. So will sterilize as young as 18-21 with no children, health issues, or significant other.

+1 [Dr. Rachel Haas](https://www.promedica.org/provider/rachel-haas-do-obstetrics?utm_campaign=reputation-management&utm_segment=gmb_listing-link&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic-search). Procedure Completed: laparoscopic salpingectomy 22, married, no children Dr. Haas didn't ask about my marital status or if I already had children. She simply made sure I knew that the procedure could not be reversed and that I was ok with this. I had to have 2 pre-surgery appointments and 1 post surgery appointment. After insurance, the procedure ended up being close to $2,000.00 out of pocket.

+1 Dr Haas, I am 24, not married (have a boyfriend), no kids. Just had a bilateral salpingectomy done this morning by her. I was able to get in to see Dr. Haas within about a month. Absolutely zero bingoes and she did not question my decision or request at all. I told her what I wanted and why and that was it! She is extremely nice, respectful, and laid back. Surgery was being scheduled out a little while so I was able to schedule it for around 2-3 months after my first appointment. She even took photos for me during the surgery per my request!

[Dr. Tiffany Slutz in Maumee, OH](https://www.promedica.org/provider/tiffany-slutz-md-gynecology-and-obstetrics). I'm a single 25 yr old woman, with no children of course. I mentioned my wish for a bi-salp during a regular checkup and she showed no hesitation in doing so. She asked me once if I was certain this is what I wanted and that was that. The scheduling process and pre-operation appointment was quick and everyone was incredibly friendly during the procedure.

**Mayfield Heights**

[Dr. Oluwatosin Goje, MD](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/18025-oluwatosin-goje) (pronounced: Go-gee) - Extremely understanding about pregnancy paranoia, Offered to check on IUD frequently if it would help settle my nerves. Consulted for permanent sterilization with no arguments at 25, submitted it to insurance that day. I decided against it in the end, but on the dr's end it was all clear. Lovely woman and doctor.

**Mt. Vernon**

[Dr. Jed Henry, MD] (https://www.kch.org/physicians/jed-w-henry-md) I went in off of a referral for an unrelated issue at the age of 21. Thinking I would kill two birds with one stone, I asked him about exploring my options for a vasectomy at the end of my original appointment. I received little push back. The only push back I got was a few rapid fire questions on why I wouldn't want children. He did have me wait six weeks for my follow up to go into further detail, however he did accept to do it. I was scheduled for a vasectomy a week from my follow up. Very understanding. Very straight forward. Friendly as well. I would recommend him to absolutely anybody. UPDATE: Operation was quick and as painless as you could make it. Amazing Doctor! If anybody sees this and decides to go in off my recommendation, tell him you got it from Reddit! I informed him he was going on this list during my operation. :) 

**Ravenna** 

Dr. Alan Rosenwasser MD (https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/rosenwasser-alan-1407922511#locations), at University Hospitals Portage Medical Center at 6847 North Chestnut Street, Ravenna, Ohio 44266 (330-296-4165). He completed a total bilateral salpingectomy on me, I am a 25 year old female, not married, and have never had any pregnancies/kids. The whole process was fast yet accommodating. I didn't have to wait long to see the doctor for the initial appointment, and he took me on as a patient fairly easily. I only had to discuss with him basic procedure questions to confirm that I understand the surgery completely and that I am certain about never wanting kids. He did not pressure me at all or make me feel wrong for my decision. They scheduled the surgery shortly after, and gave me all of the info that I needed to feel comfortable. They also worked with me to make sure it could be covered by my insurance. The surgery was smooth and easy to heal from, and every single member of the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. They were also very thorough with follow-up, which made me more confident in getting my surgery done at this facility.

**Sidney** 

Kristi Pedler, MD. I practice out of a group practice in Sidney, Ohio (West Central Ohio). Phone number is (937) 498-5373. Consults are done in private exam rooms within the office, which is in a professional building attached to the hospital I operate at. For new patient appointments, I am booked out about 3 months, surgeries are then scheduled about 1-2 months later. I accept most Ohio Medicaid insurances, I am a Medicare provider. I'm on most major private insurances. I have personally provided both tubal fulgarations as well as salpingectomies for childfree patients. I have done CF patients in their 20s after a consult to go over risks/benefits/alternatives/expectations. I want to know that my patients understand that this is permanent. I do not require letters from psych or other specialties, but I want to ensure that my patients know this is permanent. I nowadays generally do salpingectomies as this reduces the risk of ovarian cancer in the future. I personally am LGBTQ+ friendly but the area I practice in is heavily conservative. I do require it to be covered by insurance, so for the under 21s, I work with them to get it scheduled shortly after that birthday.

[Dr. Gretchen Gerace, MD](https://www.uhhospitals.org/find-a-doctor/gerace-gretchen-25766) - No bingos when I said my husband and I were not planning on ever having kids and said the IUD was a great choice for us. Cannot speak about provider's attitude toward sterilization as it's not something I'm personally interested in.

**Springboro**

**Sylvania** 

[Melanie Miller OB/GYN, CNM : referring provider](https://www.promedica.org/provider/melanie-miller-cnm-midwifery) is an amazing provider. The entire office is really incredible, and (granted I’m there relatively often) the seem to always remember me. I truly feel my care is individualized for my needs. Referred OP for a tubal at 22, unmarried. 

[Heather Wahl MD, FACOG, NCMP : performing surgeon](https://www.promedica.org/provider/heather-wahl-md-facog-ncmp-gynecology), bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy (ultimately with excision and ablation) for 22yo unmarried CF.  

[Dr. Alexis Waggoner Noss](https://www.promedica.org/provider/alexis-waggoner-noss-md-obstetrics) at Promedica Physicians Sunforest OBGYN in Sylvania, Ohio.
I had a bilateral salpingectomy done by this doctor in October of 2021. I am 27f, single, and have never had and do not want any kids, and when I mentioned to this doctor that I wanted sterilized at my first appointment with her, she had me sign the consent form for it, and a week later, the procedure was scheduled, and it was scheduled for about a month later. The only requirements she said she had were being over 21, and understanding that it's a permanent procedure.

Dr Helen OConnell - Promedica Sylvania ObGyn in Sylvania Ohio. I want to make sure people can still find me as I have definitely had a lot of folks needing help who have been refused etc by others in the past. 

**Tallmadge**

[Philip J. Smelcer, M.D., F.A.C.O.G.](https://womenshealthg.com/) - 121 Northwest Avenue Tallmadge Ohio, 330-633-1350. Tubal ligation, I am 29, married and childfree, my insurance covered the procedure. I had to wait a couple months due to covid. The doctor did not try to talk me out of the procedure. All he did was make sure I understood that it is permanent. I did not have to get my husband's permission or argue my case.

+1 Dr. Phillip Smelcer. I'm 35 years old, Married, and never had children. Dr. Smelcer is very professional. He emphasized how the procedure was permanent, but did not lecture me on anything outside the scope of normal surgery information. I had a bilateral salpingectomy. My insurance covers this procedure. Co-pay is around $1,500 for me.

**Toledo**

[Dr. Dino Santacroche](https://toledoclinic.com/doctor/dino-santacroce/) 3020 N. McCord Rd, Suite 100, 3020 N. McCord Rd, Suite 100 Toledo, Ohio 43615, and other locations in Ohio. 419-725-6850. Vasectomy on CF married redditor. I was asked: “Do you want kids? Does your wife want kids?” I answered no and that was it. My wife didn’t have to be involved. Procedure was quick and without pain. A week out I have some tenderness but nothing that really bothers me. Worst part was the initial numbing for the local.

[Dr Eric Pizza MD FACS @ Promedica Genito-Urinary Surgeons of Toledo](https://www.promedica.org/provider/eric-a-pizza-md-facs-urology) was very helpful and professional in providing a vasectomy to a 32M with no children. Quick and easy consult, quick and easy procedure. His name is pronounced "pie-suh".

[Dr Shannon Connole DO](https://www.promedica.org/provider/shannon-connole-do-obstetrics) - Maumee, agreed to sterilize me. I'm 23 and I would have gotten it done when I was 22 but I had trouble with my insurance.

[Dr. Kathryn Rivera-Litt]( https://www.promedica.org/provider/kathryn-rivera-litt-md-obstetrics ) I got referred to her by [Amber Rychener CNP]( https://www.promedica.org/provider/amber-rychener-cnp-gynecology) who works out of Sunforest Court OBGYN located at 5700 Monroe Street, Apt 303, sylvania, Ohio, 43560. I got some minor push back from Rychener but after constant persistent efforts, got my referral to Dr. Litt. Dr. Litt was incredibly professional, had great bedside manner, and did not project any bias on me for wanting the procedure even with no children. I got approved for surgery on consultation and was able to get in as soon as 2 months post initial appointment. I work for Promedica Toledo Hospital so I have their Paramount insurance plan. Overall cost was ~30k but I only paid ~3.5k out of pocket. Total time from entrance into center to leaving post surgery was about 6 hrs total. 2.5 hours preop, 2 hours OR pre anesthesia up to extubation, and 1.5 hrs PACU to discharge.

**Warren** 

Dr. Natalie Mondary of Warren, OH. She did a bisalp for me this morning. I am 29 and she did not bingo me once or try to push pills or an IUD, just accepted that I wanted sterilized and scheduled me that same day. She will sterilize regardless of marital status or age, is known to be very accepting of LGBT patients, and is body- and sex-positive. She is a hero.

**Westerville** 

[Dr. Amol Arora](https://eastwindwomenshealth.com/). Total hysterectomy. Currently 29, was 27 at start of process (covid interrupted sterilization scheduling) - long time partner (over 11 years) - no children for either of us/never pregnant either. Bilateral salpingectomy surgery would have happened at start of process, but my periods had gotten extremely worse during covid and asked for ablation on top of surgery. Found out i have a oddly shaped uterus and the ablation would either not work or only half work. Offered full hysterectomy instead to solve both problems. Doctor worked with my insurance and place of employment to make sure i got the leave necessary for recovery and insurance covering as much as possible. paid $1000 upfront for surgery, insurance (cigna) ended up covering the whole thing and reimbursed me my $1000 ($44,000 total bill no cost to me).

**West Chester**

[Dr. Buckreus @ UC Health Women's Center](http://uchealth.com/map/uc-health-physicians-office-south-west-chester/) (IUDs, Tubal Ligation, etc) I got approved for a tubal &amp;amp; Novasure at 28. He asked a few questions to make sure I was solid in my decision, knew what I was getting into, and confirm that I absolutely didn't want an IUD or birth control. Staff was extremely friendly and so nice. 

**Willoughby**

[Dr. Monique Katsuki, MD - Cleveland Clinic] (https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/20986-monique-katsuki) (Bilateral Salpingectomy)
Didn't even question me and lectured a student who was shadowing her on how women can make their own decisions and don't need a doctor to "approve" their life choices. NB Monique has moved to Florida. 

[Dr. Rebecca Crockett OB/GYN](https://lakehealth.org/doctor/rebecca-crockett/) bilateral salpingectomy, 32 F married. She went through the full list of options available for birth control to me and we talked about why I didn't want each specific thing that wasn't a bisalp. I was adamant about wanting a PERMANENT solution with the lowest possible failure rate. She stated that she typically does not sterilize women under the age of 30. So, if you have a uterus and are over 30, she's definitely a good option.

Dr. Janie Zart M.D. (female) Lake Health Women’s Health Specialists Perrico Health Center 4176 State Route 306 Willoughby, OH 44094. I (24, afab but identify as non-binary) have been seeing her for a little over a year now for period issues and I brought up my desire to be sterilized at my most recent appointment a bit out of the blue as I was too afraid to ask previously. She did not play bingo with me or ask me a ton of questions— she even stopped me when I automatically began over-explaining my reasoning and said that she understood. She explained that it is a procedure she is willing to do but only if you understand the permanence- she really drills it into you how permanent it is, because she told me she has countless patients who regret the procedure and she wants to prevent that. It will sound like she is trying to discourage you but she is just trying to make sure the patient understands the seriousness. She also was very informative about the procedure and she tends to be this way for any gynecology questions I have had, if this is something you need help with outside of just sterilization. For me personally, she said she would do a tubal ligation, and remove the Fallopian tubes entirely, not just tie or snip. For this procedure she said the only way to become pregnant afterwards is through IVF. Mod note: Do NOT accept bookings with Dr. Liese Vito who is in the same practice. 

**Xenia/Yellow Springs** 

[Drs. Scott Bembry and Kevin Edwards](https://www.premierhealth.com/ob-gyn-of-greene-county/providers) out of Xenia/Yellow Springs, Ohio. Bembry requested my bisalp, but was unable to perform the surgery due to having serious surgery himself, so Edwards performed it. It took about a month from consultation at a regular gyno appointment to the surgery date in Feb of 2022. I was 29 at the time. They were professional but not overly polite. Listened to my concerns without a lot of bingoing. They, unfortunately, have to "counsel" people about the procedure before approving/doing it according to state law and that can be intimidating, but stick to your guns and show no doubt and you should be fine. Had a scare because the nurses attending the surgery thought I needed a paper signed a month before to get the surgery. Turns out that only applies to Caresource patients. I have Anthem insurance, which covered most of the procedure. I only paid about $75.

**Youngstown** 

Doctor Vincent Ricchiuti in the Youngstown, Ohio area. Wanted signed approval for the procedure from my wife, but gave absolutely 0 pushback during consultation and vasectomy.

[Dr. Constantine G. Economus](https://constantinegeconomus.com/), Bilateral Salpingectomy, at the beginning of December 2022. I'm 30 and totally single (no long-term partner/fiancee/etc.). There are several Economous' in the Youngstown area, so make sure you're contacting the one on Boardman-Canfield Road. Office wait times seem pretty standard, and I was scheduled as quickly as I wanted (I asked to wait a few months due to work obligations). I have pretty decent insurance which they accepted no problem; had to pay about $1000 out-of-pocket to the facility where the surgery was performed. He basically asked only the required questions to make sure I fully understood the procedure, and was good about answering my questions. He also repeatedly made sure I knew/felt like I was "the boss," and was the one in control when it came to this decision. Overall he's extremely friendly and supportive, high-energy personality, great bedside manner. Really likes his fist-bumps. 10/10 experience all around.

###OKLAHOMA

**Altus**

Dr. Vicente Sanchez, Jackson County Memorial Hospital Women's Health Associates. Tubal Ligation/Endometrial Ablasion, but he offered bilateral salpingectomy. Zero bingoes, but was very thorough in explanations of procedure and made sure to ask several times of I was sure. Very understanding and accommodating, always reassuring the fact that it's my choice, not his.

**Oklahoma City** 

[Alexandra Regens](https://www.ouhealth.com/find-a-doctor/alexandra-regens-md/) Procedure: Hysterectomy Age: 23 Experience: Dr. Regens and her team were incredibly affirming, did not ask my marital status, and did not try to bingo me. She did let me know there were less invasive procedures if I wished but that it was my decision. I got the procedure for debilitating periods and my desire to be childfree. She made sure I was safe and comfortable throughout my visits and that insurance would cover it.

[Dr. Susan Chambers, MD] (https://lakesidedoctors.com/team/susan-chambers-md/) 11200 N. Portland, 2nd floor, Oklahoma City 73120 800.235.4443. Accepts Medicaid and Indian Health as well as many other insurance carriers. Performed Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingo-oophorectomy for 25 year old. No bingoes, just mention of possible IVF if needed. No children, but family history of cancers and genetic testing shown same gene defect. Did not need husband sign off.

+1 Dr.  Chambers.  Feb 2023. Bisalp on 24-year-old CF redditor. She was kind and only asked important questions like if I'd tried reversible forms of birth control before. She let me explain why I'd didn't want kids and then promptly agreed to the surgery (bilateral salpingectomy). The nurses also made me feel comfortable and validated my decision. Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Chambers.

Dr. Lisa Cheek at Midtown Woman's Clinic in Oklahoma City performed a Salpingectomy on me after 2 years w/ an IUD. I am 28, married, and childfree.

+1 Dr Cheek, Midtown Woman's Clinic, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Accepts Medicaid Info: 23F (22 when consult appointment was made), single, no children, laparoscopic bi-salp. Quick conversation, no bingos. Said it is a woman's choice. Went above and beyond. I was the only pending tubal patient and she booked the operating theater for a single patient (me).

[Kate Arnold, MD](https://www.varietycare.org/providers/provider-details/kate-arnold). Procedure Completed: Bilateral Salpingectomy Age: 29 Status: Single; Never had children nor have been pregnant. Additional Info: Dr. Arnold never questioned my decision. She was very respectful and highly values patient autonomy.

[Dr. Alexandra Regens](https://www.ouhealth.com/find-a-doctor/alexandra-regens-md/) 825 NE 10th, 3C, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, (405) 271-5239. April 2023. Hysterectomy on 23-year-old redditor due to debilitating periods and desire to be childfree. Dr. Regens and her team were incredibly affirming, did not ask my marital status, and did not try to bingo me. She did let me know there were less invasive procedures if I wished but that it was my decision. She made sure I was safe and comfortable throughout my visits and that insurance would cover it.

Dr. Shawnaree Beeson Tubal (cauterization) performed on 28 year-old after referral from another doctor and a 10 minute consult. Very respectful and knowledgable.

[Dr. Linzi Stewart.](http://southokcwomenshealthcare.com/content/linzi-stewart) Tubal (bands) performed on 25yo after one visit about birth control and a few bingos. 

+1 Dr Stewart I was mid 20s but she said she uses the Medicare/medicaid guidelines of over 21. Also asked me some bingo-esque questions but it took less than 20 minutes tops before she was good to schedule

+1 Dr Stewart, Oklahoma City, OK. Dr. Stewart and her nurse are amazing. I found her from this list. My very first visit as a brand new patient, I shared with the nurse that I am child free. She asked me what I did for birth control and SHE offered the option of sterilization before I ever spoke a word about it. I told her my partner was looking into getting a vasectomy and her response was “well there’s an issue about your autonomy, are you interested in sterilization?” I’m 28 and not a single person in the office (nurse, billing, reception, etc.) tried to change my mind. They gave me the required disclaimers about permanence and that was it. She performed the procedure and her staff was incredibly supportive, minded their business, and did their job.

[Dr. Breeanna Gibson] (https://integrisok.com/doctors/breeanna-gibson) Formerly ran the Essure clinic at OU, no bingoes or judgment on a 27 year old who had previously had the procedure. Very friendly and respectful, gave information on options if I wanted to have a reversal due to the recall, indicated she'd be supportive of any woman's childfree decision. 

+1 Dr. Gibson. March 2023. Bisalp on 32-year-old redditor. She’s a joy, and I can’t recommend her enough. She made sure my insurance covered the entire tubal! I only had to cover hospital fees and anesthesia.

+1 Dr. Gibson. April 2023. Dr Gibson immediately agreed to sterilization, and even suggested a bilateral salpingectomy as it is more effective and reduces chances of developing ovarian or fallopian cancer. She was able to code it so insurance covered my procedure, barring hospital & anesthesia fees. When it was surgery day, the nurses were so kind and helped ease my needle phobia. They sent me home with extra pain meds so I could manage my symptoms as needed. It was quick and easy—only 30 minutes! Highly recommend Dr Gibson.

[Dr. Wesley Vaughn](https://www.okcobgyn.com/) Salpingectomy (removal of fallopian tubes) performed on 36 year-old after referral from regular OB/GYN and short consult. No bingoes, just a courtesy confirmation when the conversation started. Very friendly, respectful &amp;amp; knowledgeable. Although I'm a bit older and have a few other factors that which could contribute to a doctor's decision to sterilize, he did say that he feels anyone over 21 is able to make that decision.

+1 Dr.Vaughn suggested a bilateral salpingectomy when I asked about my options in regards to tubal ligations. I agreed to go for the salpingectomy. He answered any questions I had, he was also very respectful, no bingos, no comments regarding my age. He legally had to tell me the “risks”, I then signed my consent form and booked my appointment the same day. Highly recommended for anyone in Oklahoma.

+1 Dr Vaughn, I am 30 years old so he was happy to chedule the procedure no questions asked! He even mentioned that he's done them for someone as young as 22, but I didn't get the details as to if there were health complications that would have made pregnancy unsafe for the patient, so im unsure if anyone younger than 30 will have an easier time than I did. But the fact that I didn't have kids or that I was married was not brought up. Overall experience was really great. He was happy to answer my questions. I did have to wait longer than I planned but that was due to me having to reschedule a few times. once because he had prior engagements at another hospital, and then I had to reschedule due to payment issues. OCOM surgery center 5925 NW 139th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73142 would be a better place to schedule the procedure vs integris as I was expected to have to pay a large facility fee and when I couldn't they cancelled. But OCOM was able to work out a payment plan with me. Staff was also very friendly and supportive and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable.

[Dr. Monica Reid] (bilateral total salpingectomy, laparoscopic, 31 years old) no bingoes, did ask more than once that i still wanted the surgery but not in a judgy or offputting way. Very positive, explained benefits of procedure and didn't focus on risks or try to talk me out of it

[Dr. Anthony Jackson, MD] (https://integrisok.com/doctors/anthony-jackson) Provided a bilateral salpingectomy for a 27-year-old. No bingoes. He was very supportive of my decision because I came in having considered my reasons carefully and having done my research. I did not have children previously, and my husband did not need to sign off. 

[Dr. Anthony Shanbour - Surgery Center of Oklahoma](https://surgerycenterok.com/specialists/) - Bilateral salpingectomy Age 22, single, no children. Surgery was in 2018. After years of "no" from other doctors, I was shocked that Dr. Shanbour made my surgery so easy. He scheduled the surgery during my first ever appointment with him. I listed reasons I wanted a tubal and my history of bad reactions to normal BC, and he agreed and did a routine exam. Asked one bingo the entire time - after asking if I was married (no), he asked, "If you got married, and your husband wanted a baby, what would you do?". I responded "I wouldn't marry anyone who wanted a baby" and he said "Correct answer" and then immediately went into scheduling the surgery.

[Dr. Laura Gainey](https://www.nwobgynokc.com/laura-gainey-md#) OP advises this doctor has said she is sterilization friendly! All doctors at her clinic were trained in New York and said they are very liberal/progressive and work with sterilizations. She seemed very kind and also understands trauma (spoke on it at the panel) so she is a trauma informed environment as well. I’m sure she’d be open to being contacted to confirm.

[Dr. Erin Alward](https://integrisok.com/doctors/erin-alward) I have not expressly asked if she is sterilization friendly for cis-females. But i am trans masculine and she has offered/reiterated at every appointment that if i ever want a hysterectomy to let her know and we’d start the process immediately. She has an amazing bedside manner and is very kind. I’m almost positive she would be open to it! I know she be open to being contacted to confirm as well.

**Duncan** 

[Dr. Juan Cornejo](https://www.duncanregional.com/doctors/juan-cornejo/). Procedure at the Duncan, OK hospital in the website, but he also sees patients for consults in Elgin, OK. Salpingectomy in 2023. 30, married (though engaged when I started the consult process), childfree with an IUD 8 years. Went through military's Tricare insurance. Awesome easy experience overall with Dr. Cornejo; hardest/longest part of the process was getting a referral to him from the military doctors at Fort Sill.

**Edmond** 

[Dr. Julie Hansen] (http://integrisok.com/oklahoma-doctors/Dr-Julie-Hansen) (Essure - hesitant, has had multiple patients with post-op pain; Tubal - performed on a 25 year old, some questions to make sure you've researched options and understand that this is permanent)[NOTE: This doctor does not perform sterilization procedures on anyone under the age of 25]

[Dr. Caroline Flint, Integris Edmond Women's Health](https://integrisok.com/doctors/caroline-flint). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 22, not married, childfree (no pregnancies either). You do have to be 21+ but Dr. Flint completely believes that at that age you have every right to choose to be sterilized. She disagreed with the current atmosphere of female reproductive health (trying to ban abortions and bc) and agrees it will get worse. Very friendly and professional, the appointment was 20 minutes before she said she was comfortable scheduling me for surgery.

[Dr. James Henderson](http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-james-henderson-xrhtd) (Urologist, Vasectomy) (Regular scalpel procedure, $650, (43h 21m) Basic questions, very knowledgeable and experienced, Performed on a 25 year old)

**Norman**

[Dr. Lisa Waterman](https://whcnorman.com). She is located in Norman, OK. When I mentioned I never wanted kids, she asked if I had considered tying my tubes. Let me just say I was shocked. She explained a bilateral salpingectomy, how it reduces the chances of ovarian cancer, and never once asked about my partner’s opinion. I was able to schedule it for a few weeks later and had surgery in Oct. 2021 with no complications. I was 28 when I had the procedure. I am unmarried but have been with my partner for 3+ years, and we’re both childfree. I had to pay $500 which could still be refunded if the practice can get insurance to agree to cover it.

+1 Dr Norman, Dr Lisa Waterman in Norman OK is my normal obgyn and was my surgeon for a bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 31, married, nonbinary, no kids. She made sure I understood the procedure, aftercare and whatnot, and was super supportive. I asked for an appointment asap because of my work, and they had me scheduled and the tubes out a week later.

[Dr. Ronni Farris](https://ronnifarrismd.com/) Bilateral Salpingectomy and Uterine Ablation I'm 25, no kids, no spouse. She set up my surgery appointment over the phone, never even asked my age or marital status. No bingos. Super nice and supportive, patiently answered all my questions. My nurse even said she had the same procedure done a few years back so everyone was very pro child free.

[Dr. Allison Carter](https://whcnorman.com/physicians/allison-carter-m-d/) (Bilateral Salpingectomy) Performed on a 26 year old with minimal hesitation and discussion about other birth control options. Very kind, understanding, and respectful. 

+1 Dr Carter. I have no children and have never wanted them. I received a total hysterectomy bi-lateral salpingectomy on April 6th, 2022. I was able to keep my ovaries but I told her to use her best judgement on whether they were healthy enough to keep. She was wonderful and very attentive. She listened to my reasoning of wanting the procedure done. She explained what the benefits and risks of the procedure would be with no judgment. She just wanted me to be aware of all things and asked me once more if I was sure that's what I wanted. I said yes and she said okay let's get you on the schedule. I can get you in in about 3 weeks. Got to the hospital and she asked me once more if I wanted this, requirement of the hospital, and that was it. This was an amazing experience and I was quite terrified I'd be denied but it went very well. I definitely recommend her!!!!

+1 Dr. Carter Bisalp on 24-year-old woman. Doctor is very body-positive. "There were a couple things in the discussion that people might call bingos BUT to me she more so just really wanted to make sure I had thoroughly done my research."

**Owasso/Tulsa**

[Dr. Clark Tingleaf](http://www.uticaparkclinic.com/clark-tingleaf-md#.VavPsflViko) (Vasectomy) Scalpel-free, $450, (30h 0m) no hesitation performing on 25-year old, (Bonus: no-cost semen tests for life if he did your vasectomy, good sense of humor), also performed on 23-year old with no hesitation.

**Tahlequah**

[Dr. Monique Modest-McKoy MDm OBGYN](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-monique-modest-mckoy-gdhhy) Same practice: Dr. Calvin Monroe, OBGYN. I requested to be sterilized while I was to be opened up for a women’s procedure. She agreed without any hesitation! Day of the surgery, she performed it without any prodding questions whatsoever. I asked her if she would be willing to have her name added to this list, and she enthusiastically said yes.

**Tulsa**

Dr. David Cameron, and I do lots of sterilization procedures with no questions asked (as long as their of legal age). I also am LGBT+ friendly and do gender affirming procedures. I don't have any limitations on who can get procedures as long as they are a legal adult and tell me they are certain in their decision. I work at Utica Park Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is located in Hillcrest Medical Center. I also work at Hillcrest in Henryetta Oklahoma once a week. I accept almost all insurance plans, except Community Care, since that is a Catholic based plan.

+1 Dr Cameron, He performed a bisalp on me (22, single) with no bingos, "are you sure"? questions, etc. I just talked about why I want it done for a couple minutes and he agreed & said he'll do sterilizations for adults, as long as they understand what they're doing. He's a great doctor and was very supportive.

[Dr. Kathleen Heffron](http://www.twhg.com/html/Heffron.html) (Tubal) Performed on 25 year old though she was hesitant. Cauterization method.
(Tubal) Performed on 24 year old. Salpingectomy. Some questions to make sure you've researched. Said she would not sterilize a 21 year-old. 

Kevin Gancarczyk M.D. Urologic Specialists 10901 East 48th Street South Tulsa, OK 918-749-8765 / 18008765645

Dr. Melissa Dietz UTICA WOMEN'S SPECIALISTS 918-749-1413; tubal ligation for 40 yr old - didn't question decision but did cover all other BC options (which I think is probably standard)

+1 Dr Dietz, bilateral salpingectomy, 26F, unmarried, no children and childfree, diagnosed with endometriosis. Dr. was very straightforward with little resistance when I asked for a bisalp for both sterilization and cancer prevention purposes. Stated she did not consider it a total sterilization because it left patients with the option of pursuing IVF if desired at a later time. On my first visit with her she scheduled my bisalp immediately and got it done a month later. She did briefly visit me in the hospital prior to surgery to confirm my choice, and did reiterate that I still have the option of IVF in the future. Her office was extremely communicative and always returned calls within the day.

[Dr. Jennifer Donnelly](https://www.tulsaobgyn.com/donnelly.htm). She performed a bilateral salpingectomy. I am 25 F and have been childfree for at least 5 years.

[Dr. Daniel Dowswell](https://www.samhealth.org/patient-visitors/find-a-doctor/d/dowswell-daniel-1912999236) at Samaritan OBGYN in Albany, OR. I am 24, married, no kids, and childfree. He did my bilateral salpingectomy and the only question he asked was "Are you 100% sure?" and then he let me sign the consent form the same day. He and his staff were all very friendly and I would highly recommend.

**Astoria** 

[Doctor Kelly Edwards](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/kellie-edwards-702402) in Astoria, Oregon. After getting a referral from my primary doctor and meeting with her, she seemed very open to doing a full hysterectomy despite only being 21 and not having kids. There was no bingo, not even a question about possible regrets or making me doubt myself. I told her I've been doing a lot of research and was prepared for it, and that was good enough for her. When I mentioned my concerns about insurance, she said she did procedures like that all the time and spoke with people's insurance often. In less than two months, I had my procedure. Until the procedure, she gave me medicine to halt my periods and give me a sense of comfort. She was with me the entire process, not just being the surgeon, but she visit me beforehand to check how I was feeling, while in the bed waiting to be wheeled in, and then again while I was in recovery, where she brought me something to eat. All in all, I felt very safe with Doctor Kelly Edwards and despite my stress and nerves, I felt comfortable putting my surgery in her hands.

Doctor Andrew Chin in Astoria Oregon, USA. I went in requesting a hysterectomy and Doctor Chin was very willing to send a referral to a clinic without even questioning my reason for wanting one, then saying he would continue to send referrals to clinics until one was willing to do it with insurance covering it. Within two weeks of my visit, I didn't just have an appointment with a clinic, but had an appointment with the surgeon and began the process of obtaining one. I'd very much like Andrew Chin added to the childfree-friendly doctors list. In a small town like Astoria and the nearest city being hours away, childfree doctors are wonderful to find.

[Dr. Andrew Neeb, MD - Urology Specialists of Oregon](http://www.urologyinoregon.com) (Vasectomy)

**Corvallis**

[Dr. Andrea Prabhu](https://www.corvallisclinic.com/providers/andrea-prabhu-md/) with the Corvallis Clinic in Corvallis, Oregon. Short summary for my recommendation: She is my regular gyno as well & was very proactive in getting me this procedure as soon as I asked about it, because I’d told her it was something I wanted years earlier & I have already tried the long-term contraception options. She is so warm & kind & a very strong patient advocate. I felt very safe with her, which is saying a lot because every other time I’ve had gyno appointments, they end up triggering some past trauma. She is a wonderful doctor & made this whole process very easy & straightforward.

[Dr Nicole Kruppa, MD at The Corvallis Clinic](https://www.corvallisclinic.com/providers/nicole-kruppa-md/) Laparoscopic Salpingectomy- No bingos and very supportive.

[Paul Daskalos, DO.](https://www.samhealth.org/patient-visitors/find-a-doctor/d/daskalos-paul-1871536961). Bilateral salpingectomy. I’m 26, unmarried, no children. Scheduled the surgery during the consultation, fully covered by Medicaid, no bingos whatsoever and didn’t even ask why I wanted it done or if I had a partner.

Andrea J McCann, MD FACOG. Samaritan Ob Gyn - 541-768-5300. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I’m an Ob Gyn in Corvallis Oregon with Samaritan Health and joined this group as a resource to support folks choosing sterilization. I am happy to answer any questions about tubal sterilization. And I will add my name to the list of docs."

+1 Doctor McCann has been my gyno for a few years now so I was comfortable asking my primary care doctor for a referral to her office for sterilization. Andrea listened to the reasons I didn’t want children and explained that despite there not being any requirements on marital status, number of kids you have to have, or age that many doctors wouldn’t preform this surgery because of risk of regret but she wasn’t one of them. She only told me this was my choice alone even if I regretted it in the future. One of my worries was because I’m about to turn 26 I was about to lose my parents health insurance. Thankfully Dr. McCann reassured me that she would get me in before my insurance expired even though I had to wait 30 days before I could have the surgery to make sure this is what I wanted. My first appointment to discuss sterilization was February 21st 2022, insurance approved everything in about a week, and then surgery was scheduled for April 7th 2022.

Zoryana Thompson at Samaritan Gynecology and Surgical Associates.  I brought my whole binder full of research and she hardly even looked at it. No bingo questions either. She just feels strongly about everyone's bodily autonomy. It's my choice. It's better to regret not having kids than to regret the kid you have. 

[Dr. Erin Massey, Corvallis, Oregon.](https://www.samhealth.org/patient-visitors/find-a-doctor/m/massey-erin-1457478620). Dr. Massey performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me. I am 24 years old, unmarried, and in a relationship (though she did not ask for my relationship status or marital status at any point). I have no children and intend to remain childfree. Dr. Massey was very professional and never made me feel intimidated or patronized in any way. Insurance required that I wait 30 days between the consultation and the surgery in case I change my mind which Dr. Massey expressed disapproval of. She informed me of all of the risks of surgery and told me there is a small risk of regret but reassured me that people in my category (people who have never had children) were the least likely to experience regret and in fact have a near zero likelihood of experiencing regret. She asked me to briefly let her know why I wanted the procedure if I felt comfortable, but it was evident that she was just doing her job and not probing me or looking for holes in my logic. She was very adamant that this was my decision and my decision alone. Overall a very positive experience and I would feel safe recommending Dr. Massey to others who wish to remain childfree.

**Eugene** 

[Dr. Naomi Light, MD](https://www.oregonmedicalgroup.com/physicians-providers/naomi-light). I (29F, unmarried, CF) had an excellent experience with Dr. Light for my laparoscopic tubal ligation. She was friendly and completely supportive with zero pushback during my consult, a great listener, and highly knowledgeable. I had a short wait for my consult and under 6 weeks for procedure. The new patient consult cost was a bit steep with Cigna but my surgery OOP was very reasonable. The surgery itself was brief and uncomplicated with quick recovery. Light's staff was impeccable, so personable and centered on patient experience. I really can't recommend her enough.

[Dr Kimberly Edwards](https://pacificwomenscenter.com/), Bilateral Salpingectomy, She stated to me that she is a big supporter of humans who want to take the step if they seem very sure, regardless of age. I mentioned I had read a lot of stories about women being denied etc but she put all those worries at ease. I am putting her forth as a wonderful woman who supports the right to choose. And I was hoping maybe getting her on the list could help some other folks. The Pacific Women's Center was really friendly and my experience was shockingly smooth and quick (short waiting period of my healthcare).

[Dr. Sara Gerhards](https://pacificwomenscenter.com/doctors/sara-p-gerhards-md). Office number: 541-342-8616. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I would be happy to assist anyone in the desire to not reproduce for whatever reason. Your gender identity, number of previous pregnancies, and age are not relevant; as long as you can legally give consent.  And yes, appropriate counseling is needed.  This “counseling” means you and I have one conversation so I can document that you are the one making this decision, you are not be coerced, and you understand the details, risks, implications, and benefits of the procedure. Counseling does not mean you need to see a therapist. The counseling is for insurance and legal- it is NOT you convincing me you are able to make a decision for your body! Let me know if I can help!

+1 Dr. Gerhards. I'm 21, 20 when I first saw her for a surgery consult. Single and childfree. Dr. Gerhards was very passionate about her desire to help anyoneseek sterilization. She immediately approved me at my consult with no bingos. Took my United Healthcare insurance. Dr. Gerhards is a surgeon who works with pregnant patients as well and I did have to reschedule a few appointments because my surgery wasn't as immediately necessary as women having birthing complications which was unfortunate. I'd recommend her if you're younger because she gave me zero pushback and was very happy to help me get the surgery I wanted.

Dr Melanie Konradi, Eugene. She's with Oregon Medical Group/Peacehealth. She performed a bilateral salpingectomy for me in 2020. My experience with her was wonderful! I don't have any kids so I was expecting pushback, but there was none. Once I brought it up, it was like any other elective procedure: we chatted about what it would entail, she answered my questions, and we got it scheduled. She's amazing.

Dr Katria Mertz. She bi salped me 2 years ago no questions asked. 

[Dr. Brant Cooper](https://www.womenscare.com/providers/brant-cooper-md/), Eugene, Oregon, Bilateral salpingectomy, and he also was willing to do a tubal. 26. Single. Don’t currently have children, have never wanted children, and will never want children. He asked a few of the standard “are you sure” questions, but he took my answers at face value, he believed me, he and didn’t try to debate me. No bingos at all. He was willing schedule the surgery right away, but it took about a month for my insurance to approve it. I was able to schedule the surgery just a few weeks after that. Everyone was friendly, nonjudgmental, and non-argumentative. His office accepts Medicaid!

[Dr. Sohee Williams](https://pacificwomenscenter.com/). Bilateral salpingectomy, 2022 (30F, unmarried, childfree). Dr. Williams is an incredible clinician and surgeon. Super high quality care, explained things thoroughly and answered my many many questions. Made it clear during consult that patient choice was her top priority. Appointments can be hard to get/rescheduled but worth the wait - 6mo. After a referral from my PCP, all my appointments, prescriptions, and procedure were 100% covered by Medicaid. I had a minor complication (not her fault) and she went above and beyond to make sure I was safe and got the care I needed.

Cynthia Lewsi-Berry, MA LMFT, Counselor that is encouraging of the childfree lifestyle

**La Grande** 

Dr Dawn Knight. She works at the Grande Ronde Hospital’s Women’s health clinic in La Grande, Oregon. She performed my bilateral laparoscopic tubal ligation yesterday after being referred to her by my primary care provider. She’s a big deal for all of the women in Eastern Oregon who may be looking for something similar, we’re few and far between for good drs here. For reference, i’m a 29y/o female, no children

**Lake Oswego** 

[Dr. Megan Zaander](https://lakeoswegogyn.com/our-practice/dr-megan-zaander/) in Lake Oswego, OR. I live in Portland and she’s not too far, so anyone in the area can see her. She was AMAZING- told me right off the bat she supports my decision and even mentioned how it’s great my partner doesn’t want kids either, but it’s not his choice. I felt so at ease with her and even the anesthesiologist was great. Dr. Zaander was wonderful from start to finish and I would love for others to know she’s available! I have Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal and they covered everything but $200 because I also got my Nexplanon removed during the procedure

**Medford** 

Dr.Conklin at Providence OBGYN 20, AFAB, long term relationship but not married, CF. I wrote a couple pages on my bad experiences with different birth control methods and my thought process behind my choice and she was on board immediately. No bingos, absolutely no BS, she made sure I was fully aware it was permanent and supported me through the entire process. Forever grateful :)

**Portland**

[Dr. Jessica Reid MD](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/jessica-reid-md-mcr) 808 S.W. Campus Drive, Portland, OR 97239, 503-418-4500. March 2023. Bisalp on 26-year-old. After referral by PCP, I initially met with Sara Fahey, a CNM at OHSU. She did the initial appointment with consents, etc. and then sent me off to get scheduled for my bisalp. I did not meet with Dr. Reid prior to the day of my procedure, but she and all of the residents I met were fantastic and supportive of my decision. 

[Lisa K. Johnson at Women's Healthcare Associates in Portland Oregon](https://www.whallc.com/providers/lisa-k-johnson-md/). Performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on 24 y/o AFAB NB patient with no children, just over 3 months from consultation to surgery. No bingos, just told her I had a deep fear of pregnancy and didn't want kids, and she immediately started going over my options in terms of recovery time, insurance coverage, and my wants/needs. Great experience!

[Dr. Edna Kung Portland, Oregon](https://www.zocdoc.com/doctor/edna-kung-md-36864). She did my bisalp at 28, no kids, no questions asked. Amazing and supportive.

[Dr Richard Rosenfield](https://www.pearlwomenscenter.com/), Pearl Women's Center in Portland. In my consult he said something to the effect of he doesn't turn uterus owners away at 18+ for wanting sterilization. It was incredibly refreshing, and it seems like him and all the folks in their office work really hard to make the patient comfortable (big ask from my doc averse ass, but he made it happen). The place he works has a surgical center on site so you don't have to deal with a hospital. Doc even removed endometriosis no other docs believed I could have had (because "the period pain you experience can't be that bad") and I didn't even need any painkillers for post OP care! He even speaks Spanish.

[Dr. Gene De Haan, MD](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/gene-dehaan-3541258) Kaiser Permanente. Location: Portland, Oregon. Procedure Completed: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy, 28 years old, unmarried, Now and Always Childfree. Dr. Gene De Haan provided a compassionate, well-explained, and straightforward experience for my sterilization. The time from when I initially called up Kaiser to ask about sterilization to my sterilization appointment was 1 month. My insurance covered everything except a handful of $10 copays for the various (remote) appointments leading up to sterilization, but this will depend on your insurance with Kaiser. I felt very safe, respected, and well-informed with Dr. De Haan as my surgeon.

[Dr Dafna Lohr, MD](https://www.legacyhealth.org/providers/dafna-lohr) Women's Healthcare Associates, LLC, 1130 NW 22nd Avenue, Suite 520, Portland, OR 97210, 503 274-4800.
(Salpingectomy) Approved for procedure at 22. Also approved one for me (different person) at age 20.

+1 Dr. Lohr. Bisalp on 34-year-old redditor, Dec 2022.

-1 Dr. Lohr. April 2023. Dafna Lohr lectured me about women changing their minds about sterilization. She was ultimately willing to perform the surgery, but I could not move forward because I had a complication when she removed my IUD in-office (complicated procedure where it broke and pieces were missing). That caused a chain of extremely negative experiences with this doctor where she invalidated my concerns, did not communicate about what had happened, and attempted to hide key information re a piece of the IUD that remains embedded in my cervix. I would not recommend anyone go to her. She is not trauma-informed.

[Dr. Gregory Cost, MD - The Oregon Clinic Urology](https://www.oregonclinic.com/our-team/urology/gregory-alan-cost) Time between visit and referral from primary doc to consult and no-scalpel Vasectomy (same day) was two weeks. No pushback.

+1 Dr. Cost. Nov 2022 Vasectomy on CF redditor. I had to wait about two months for an appointment, but was able to have the consult and vasectomy on the same day. The "consult" was super quick - just him making sure either we were done having kids or didn't want them, and that we knew it was permanent. No bingos at all.

+1 Dr Piszczek, she performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me without questioning my decision whatsoever. A direct quote from her is "I'm required to ask if you've considered other birth control options, but it's your body and you should do what you want with it." I am 41, in a relationship but unmarried, and child free.

[Dr. Oscar Polo, MD, FACOG](https://www.oregonclinic.com/our-team/oscar-polo) (Laparoscopic Bilateral Tubal Resection - He is extremely kind.  He basically asked me if I knew it was permanent, I said yes, and he said ok, let's get you scheduled. I am a 29 year old female with no children. The appointment took a grand total of about 15 minutes, if that.  While he practices at the Oregon Clinic, he preforms this surgery at East Portland Surgeons. Definitely recommend.) 

-1 Dr Polo, single 26F, and met with Dr. Oscar Polo (Portland Oregon) to inquire about female sterilization/tubal. He told me i should "just use condoms or the nuva ring" (among a lot of other pressures to just remain on a birth control because my periods may be bad ???) And because "a lot of [his] patients come back in 10 years crying over having had the procedure done." Ultimately he said he would preform the surgery but he "doesn't think it's the best option" for me. The felt uncomfortable and definitely don't want a doctor doing the surhery against what they think is appropriate despite not having listened to anything I said.

[Dr. Nicholas Fogelson, MD - Pearl Women's Center](http://www.pearlwomenscenter.com/about/dr-fogelson.cfm) (Bilateral salpingectomy. Was super nice and professional. 24F, no previous births, never used birth control--made sure I understood that it's permanent, but didn't give me any bingos.)

[Michael P. Traynor, Obstetrics and Gynecology](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/michael-traynor-0370711) - Bilateral Salpingectomy. 24 and engaged at time of approval, no children and never wanted children. Was very receptive of the fact that I was childfree and even wrote in my chart the exact words I used. Immediately offered bilateral salpingectomy without questioning my age or lack of children. Did mention he had patients similar to my age come back in their 30s crying about having made this decision so young but did not pressure me to change my mind. The surgery team called to schedule the operation around 3 weeks after initial appointment, surgery itself was done around 3 months after initial appointment. Did not bingo me once before/during/after the procedure.

[Dr. Michelle Quinn, MD](https://www.whallc.com/providers/michele-t-quinn-md-mhsc-ms/), this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I perform sterilization by mini-laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy for childfree people"

[Shaalini Ramanadhan](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/shaalini-ramanadhan-md), I’m 28/unmarried/no kids/Portland, OR. My tubal ligation surgery was free through Medicaid. I just got my tubal today with Shaalini at OHSU, she’s been my gyne for the last year now and has always supported my decision to be childfree. Not ONCE did she, or anyone on the team the day of surgery, make comments about how I may change my mind/want kids/make a mistake, she gave me all the info without judgement and was excited with me through the whole process :) couldn’t ask for a better experience.

[Dr. Caroline Kelly, M.D] (https://womenshealthso.com/providers/caroline-kelly-md/) Open minded and willing to do surgery!

[Dr. Sarah Jordan](http://www.grapevinewomenshealth.com/doctors/dr-sarah-jordan/), Grapevine Women's Health and Gynecology, LLC (Essure, mentioned that she is likely to suggest alternatives such as IUD if patient is under 25, due to prefrontal cortex not being completely developed until 25, however no pushback was personally experienced at 27. Great bedside manner and appreciates humor, not judgmental.)

[Dr. Katherine Nelson, OBGYN](https://www.tuality.org/provider/katherine-nelson/?clinic=tuality-obstetrics-gynecology), Tuality Obstetrics and Gynecology, (Bilateral Salpingectomy, 31F, no pushback, no judgements against me, no bingos, just respect for my choices. She said I was obviously well-informed and knew what I wanted. She is very straightforward, sometimes monotone, but an amazing doctor. She also performed my surgery and did a fabulous job and was very caring all through the process. Presently accepts OHP- Tuality Health Alliance which is one type of state insurance. Unsure in regards to other insurance.)

I was 30 when Dr. Tan preformed my hysterectomy. While the surgery was mainly to treat endometriosis, and high risk cervical dysplasia, I had been discussing sterilization with him prior to my endometriosis diagnosis at the age of 26, and was single at that time.

**Salem**

Dr. Darcy L. Blanchard, DO - Salem Clinic (Bilateral Salpingectomy) - Agreed to a bilateral salpingectomy after explaining other forms of birth control, however, my age (32) may have worked in my favor.

Dr. Frederick H Frank MD - Salem Clinic (Bilateral Salpingectomy and Endometrial Ablation) - Respectfully counseled on other options and agreed to perform these procedures on me at age 23 with no children. 

Dr. Robert J. Harder - [Salem Clinic](https://salemclinic.org/physicians/obstetrics-and-gynecology/robert-harder) For 21 female, with no children. The consultation took 20 minutes, I explained what I wanted, that I am informed of my alternative options, and why a tubal is best for me. He had me sign a consent form and will perform a laparoscopic tubal ligation cauterization 30 days from the consultation. 

[Dr. Valerie Joyce Heffner in Salem, Oregon](https://salemclinic.org/physicians/obstetrics-and-gynecology/valerie-joyce-heffner). She performed my bilateral salpingectomy & IUD removal just a couple weeks ago and was amazing. Time between first consultation visit and actual procedure was just under 2 months, she was 100% immediately supportive and on board. I am 37F but when I told her that I sought permanent birth control ten years ago at 27 and was rejected and only given an IUD she was genuinely outraged in response and very vocal about respecting women's reproductive choices. 

Curtis Hawkinson in Salem, Oregon at the Doctor's Clinic at 5050 Skyline Village Loop S, Salem, OR, 97306. He has been supportive of both myself and my (also childfree) sister when we asked about permanent sterilization, and offered to give us referrals, though he did acknowledge that being a somewhat conservative town it may be hard to find someone to do the surgery. Regardless he is very supportive and generally just a very nice guy I've been seeing for years.

Kaaren Burnett, who works at the same office as Curtis. She was my gynecologist and was incredibly supportive of my decision to be childfree, even considering I was 22 at the time we met. While I didn't ask her for sterilization at the time for financial reasons, I have no doubt she would be an excellent person for people in Salem to talk to about their childfree, birth-control related needs!

**Allentown** 

[Dr Ernesto Rodriguez located in Allentown, PA](https://www.lvhn.org/doctors/ernesto-rodriguez) (Truly lgbtq friendly). I had my hysterectomy about 3 weeks ago and from first appointment to operation was about 2 months because his schedule is fairly full. I’m a childfree 31 yr old.

Dr. Michael S. Patriarco [St Lukes Center for Advanced Gynecological Care](http://www.slhn.org/Hospitals-Locations/Physician-Group/Advanced-Gynecologic-Care-Center) Tubal ligation; I'm 25. As long as you are an informed patient, this doctor respects your decision.

[Dr. Timothy M. Pellini](https://www.lvhn.org/doctors/timothy-pellini) (Lehigh Valley Health Network). Very helpful, supportive, skillful. Primary belief is the right of the individual to make her own reproductive choices. Entire surgical team is lovely. Performs ligation, salpingectomy. Gave me a bilateral salpingectomy at 21. Address 1245 S Cedar Crest Blvd Suite 201 Allentown, Pennsylvania 18103-6267 Phone 610-402-4870

+1 Dr Pellini, approved me for a bisalp at 19! Was extremely considerate and polite, completely respected my choices.

+1 Dr Pellini, without a doubt the most courteous and respect medical professional I've ever dealt with. I met with him once for about 15 minutes before he approved me for a bisalp at 27. He performed the surgery himself this past June and I had no doubts that I was receiving the best care. My scarring is minimal and I was back to normal life within 3 days. He's now my gyno, even though it means 40 minutes of driving for me to see him whereas my previous gyno is less than 5 minutes away. I'm so very happy that I found him on this list and can now vouch for him.

+1 Dr Pellini, this doctor performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me almost a year ago. I was 22, unmarried, and childfree. He was on my side the whole way through and for once I felt like someone was actually listening. As long as you are an informed patient, he will perform the surgery. I was able to be scheduled in about 2 months after consult.

+1 Dr Pellini, completed my bilateral salpingectomy at 27. The first thing he said to me when I met him was, "You don't have to convince me of anything, the only person who needs to be convinced is you." He gave me a run down of the procedure and then told me someone would call me to schedule. This was in September and I had the surgery in December. I was amazed afterwards when I saw the incisions. I'd been worried about scarring (I hadn't even mentioned it to him though) and all I had was an incision in my belly button and a tiny incision below my bikini line. I literally can't imagine having a better experience and I feel lucky I met him.

[Dr. Andrea Ardite, MD](https://findadoctor.slhn.org/details/3124). Complete salpingectomy for sterilization. I’m 31, engaged, no kids. I did a consult and brought my partner. She stated very clearly that it was my choice and she wasn’t there to enforce her beliefs on anyone else. Dr. Ardite seemed very open and supportive to being childfree despite having her own kids. The only thing she brought up was my weight (I’m 350 lbs) but not in relation to the surgery. She’s booked out until March but because it’s a quick procedure there’s a chance to get in earlier.

[Dr Angelisanti](https://www.lvhn.org/doctors/susan-angelisanti) located in Allentown, PA, bilateral salpingectomy. She has been great throughout the entire process, even having suggested the procedure to me when I brought up not wanting kids. My procedure was covered entirely by my insurance.

[Dr. Steven Berliner - UPMC Altoona AFP Family Centered OB/GYN](http://findadoc.upmc.com/PhysicianBioQuery.aspx?EPCDID=219318) (It was his suggestion that I have a hysterectomy at 32 instead of an endometrial ablation + tubal ligation as treatment for heavy, painful periods and endometriosis.

Dr. Patrica Vidger Tri-State Ob/gyn I asked about permanent sterilization as a 26 year old and what I would need to do. She said “sign some consent forms” I had her confirm that she doesn’t care if you’re married or need consent from anyone else. A friend of mine who was not her patient contacted her and went through with it. No weird waiting period or anything. I can’t speak for any other doctors in the practice.

[Dr. Kathleen Ackert and Star Community Health OBGYN](https://findalocation.slhn.org/details/11216). We are happy to perform a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on anyone over the age of 21 in the state of PA who has received counseling that it is a permanent & irreversible procedure, and that if they do want to be pregnant in the future, it would be through IVF. If they are cool with that, we are good to go! We also have a social worker that assists with insurance coverage. I do discuss risk of regret under age of 30, but we all live by the motto: your body, your choice. We are here to provide options and you get to choose which works best for you. If kids aren't part of the plan, happy to be your surgeon. We also offer gender affirming hysterectomies!

[Dr. Denice Leonard](https://www.butlerhealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/denice-m-leonard-do/). I received a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (full removal of tubes). I'm 29, divorced and never had kids or got pregnant. Dr. Leonard did go through the list of questions (what about regret, why can't your partner get a vasectomy, ect). I did research prior on these and talked with conviction and that's what helped convince to do the procedure. I have Aetna and it completely paid for everything (bonus was she was in-network for me.) Surgery wise, she goes through the belly button and that's where all the incisions are. I left same day from the hospital and I had a one week follow up and that's it. This was my first major surgery and I'm recovering great!

Dr. Caroline Heise, GYN, Doylestown Gynecology. Agreed to a tubal for me at 28, told me that any woman who is 100% sure deserves to choose sterilization!

-1 Dr Heise I've been going to this practice for years, and they have not been helpful to me. I've tried time and again for sterilization and was told that I'd need a psych evaluation before someone would even talk to me about it. I've been brushed off and most recently pressured to be put on a hormonal IUD despite the history of negative effects the hormones have had with me. 

[Dr. Scott Dinesen](https://axiawh.com/locations/dinesen-and-associates-obgyn/), DO, FACOG, Dinesen &amp; Associates OB/GYN &amp; Infertility. Super professional. At my initial appointment, I was about to read off a list of all the reasons I wanted the procedure because I thought I would have to convince him, but he stopped me before I even started and said I didn’t have to explain anything. Had my surgery (Bilateral Salpingectomy) within a month. He has 20 years experience.

Dr. Frank Roland, Urologist, Central Bucks Urology. Was very professional and understanding when my husband wanted a vasectomy. (Note: Do NOT see Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald at the practice- He initially gave my husband a hard time since we didn't have kids, I suggested Dr. Roland because he has been great with my issues, and he was very supportive!)

**Dubois**  

Dr Steven Koch, Obstetrics/Gynecology- Penn Highlands Women's Care (Bilateral Salpingectomy) Dr Koch was friendly and willing to help me get sterilized after only two visits at the age of 23. The team was great and the doctor did wonderful on the surgery. Would highly recommend him to others.

[Dr. Ellen Hancox MD FACOG.](https://doctors.ahn.org/Ellen-M-Hancox ) LBGTQ+ friendly. Dr Hancox has contacted us with the following, "I’m a board certified OB/Gyn with a new practice in Erie PA. I am very happy to perform salpingectomies for women regardless of parity/marital status. I’m willing to operate on women as young as 18, but insurance can be a problem if under age 21. I work with one partner, Dr. Culbertson who practices similarly to me. (She may prefer age 23+)."

+1 Dr. Hancox. Dec 2022. Laparoscopic hysterectomy on 26-year-old redditor after request for bisalp. Dr. discovered early stage cancer during preparatory exam.

[Sarah Achenbach](https://www.obgynoferie.com/providers/physicians/) - Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy at 25 years old. Dr. Achenbach is absolutely wonderful, the only pushback was her asking "ok, and you're super sure about this?" a few times. With my constant agreement she didn't press on actual bingos. The best thing is, I went in for a new patient/routine checkup, asked about the bi-salp for the first time at the end of said appt, and the surgery date was scheduled right then and there. 2 months later and it's done! Lucky to have gotten it covered by my insurance (Highmark).

[Dr. Michael Scutella](obgynoferie.com) at OBGYN Associates of Erie Erie, Pennsylvania, I am unmarried, childfree, and 23 years old. He preformed my tubal litigation after asking on my first visit. He asked me if I was sure and asked what I would do if I changed my mind. He was very thourough with explaining the procedure and recovery and did not press me after I said I was sure I did not want children.

**Farrell** 

Dr. Qudsia Ladani, I set up a consultation, and she asked if I was sure I never wanted kids and didn't want long term birth control instead, and when I said no she quickly agreed to give me a bisalp. Disclaimer: she said she agreed because I was sure I didn't want kids and was over 30, so she may not agree for younger childfree folks.

**Franklin** 

[Dr. Eric G. Fackler, MD](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Eric+G.+Fackler/1320476) - Bilateral salpingectomy - 29, single, no children - He was great to me. No bingos from him or any of the staff. He speed-read through all of the alternatives, and just asked if I sure I wanted the bisalp. After the 30 day wait required by my insurance, my tubes were gone. I had originally wanted to do an endometrial ablation at the same time, but he wants to hold off for now since he said it can cause more problems than its worth.

**Gettysburg** 

Dr. Brittany L Jackson, "I am a gynecologist based out of Gettysburg, PA. My practice address is 450 S Washington Street, Ste B, Gettysburg, PA 17325. We can be reached at 717-337-4487. It is a hospital owned practice so a separate building across the street from the hospital. We take all major insurances to my knowledge, but our front desk staff can answer more specific questions. I’m relatively new to this practice but have not run into any concerns. There is an age limit of 21 in our health network based on our state insurance limitations. I will always appropriately counsel someone about reversible options and/or vasectomy, but have no other requirements regarding marital or childbearing status."

From the time I joked about getting sterilized to actually getting sterilized was a little over a month. No questions asked, no trying to convince me otherwise. The most I had to do was watch a video at my surgical intake about what sterilization is.

+1 Dr Cargado-Leynes, just got my bisalp done by her last Friday as a 30F childfree woman.

-1 Dr. Cargado-Leynes had her mind made up before she even spoke with me. I made it very clear that I've never wanted kids and never would, but she shot down everything I told her. The reasons she gave me for not performing the surgery were that I am "too young (age 25) and not married".

She accepted my answer of "in the unlikely event that I change my mind, I'll adopt." Without hesitation.

**Kittanning**

[Dr Andrea Skomo](https://www.acmh.org/obgyn). Tubal ligation - an ablation was offered. 21 - single - 0 Kids. I went to her wanting birth control but thinking about sterilization. I decided to try and IUD first, however when that failed and I decided to go with sterilization the only thing she said to me was "I am required to tell you about the risk of regret" I got scheduled for my surgery that day and had it done within a month.

+1 Dr Skomo, married 28F - laparoscopic bi-salp & endometrial ablation (NovaSure) done in Oct 2022 - I was able to schedule my procedure the day of my first/only consultation visit. The consultation was very fast - I think I scheduled it 5ish days in advance, and the appointment itself was only 15 mins. She was impressed with the research I’d already done to be familiar with my options, and I’d gone in knowing exactly what procedure I wanted. She said she was required to ask what if I end up divorced & meeting someone who wants kids and my response was that I’d be done with that person (lol). No waiting period with my insurance, but I was required to go back for 2 additional pre-surgery visits - once for a uterine tissue biopsy and once for bloodwork.

I am 27 years old, married and childfree. Dr. Bungo treated me with the utmost bodily autonomy. She recognized this as my sole decision and didn't give me any bingos.

She was professional and very caring.

[Dr. Kate Stampler](https://providers.einstein.edu/provider/Kate+Stampler/1450905). Procedure completed: (laparoscopic salpingectomy), 32, marital status: single, childfree: yes. I had been asking other ob-gyns to sterilize me since I was 16 but no one would. Dr. Stampler made me wait 1 year (which is reasonable since she'd never met me before) and then did the surgery. She is well-trained in this type of surgery and I had a good recovery. She is very much a proponent of reproductive justice. FYI: she is trans-friendly despite the cis-centric language in the Jenkintown waiting room (she is trying to get that changed).

I went to a Dr. Frank Cardona, Jr. as a new patient and he scheduled my surgery for two weeks after my first appointment with him. He asked if I understood the surgery was permanent and told me he thought it was ridiculous I had to fight to get my iud. He was very supportive of my decision, provided zero negative judgement for the decision, made sure to verify I was doing ok before my surgery and during my follow up appointment he just wanted to make sure I was recovering quickly.

Asked on November 30 surgery done December 27. Single, no children, 29 years old. Never bingoed by dr. One older nurse did ask if I really didnt want children and when I said I had 4 cats and could not imagine dealing with a child she completely understood and proceeded to tell me about her 2 cats.

Some insurance companies have their own rules like a 30-day waiting period for patients with Pennsylvania Medicaid, but that is not my own rule, and if the insurance company has no such requirements, I am generally able to offer surgery dates within 1-2 months. I tend to have a long wait list for an initial appointment, but patients can ask for a "surgical consult referred from the Reddit list" and I will do my best to get them in.

[Dr. Yu-Hsin Wu, Penn Obstetrics and Gynecology (3701 Market)](https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/yu-hsin-wu). Agreed to a tubal ligation on unmarried 31F with no questions besides "why?" and "do you understand that it's irreversible?" 

[Dr. Nicole Salva](https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/nicole-salva). Did tubal ligation on a 26 year old married woman respectfully and without unreasonable questioning. Practice was professional and there were no bingos.

[Dr. Justin Ziemba](https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/justin-ziemba?fadf=pennmedicine&keyword=vasectomy). Vasectomy on a 27 year old unmarried (but have a long-term girlfriend) male, no previous kids. Seen in September of 2020, had the surgery performed 40 days later. Dr. Ziemba showed some concern about my young age and having no previous kids, but did not try to stop me or dissuade me in any way, just wanted to make sure it's what I wanted and that I knew reversal was not 100%. Semen analysis at 3 and 5 months, no further testing required.

[Victor L. Carpiniello, MD](https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/victor-carpiniello?fadf=PennMedicine). Vasectomy. Age: 30. Gender: Male. Martial status: committed partnership for 6 years. Childfree status: childfree (no kids). Wait time for procedure was about 2 months out -- doctor only schedules surgical procedures for Thursday mornings. I took the earliest booking available. My insurance (Aetna) will cover most of the procedure. I pay $300 (deductible) + 20% of procedure costs. Procedure will include sedation. No BINGOs, no questions about "why." All staff were professional and treated me with respect. I had the same experience on procedure day. Staff were all courteous and did not ask questions about why I was having the surgery. As an aside, Penn Medicine has a blog on vasectomies where they state the only question the doctor's will ask is to make sure that the patient knows that the vasectomy is [permanent](https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/march/7-things-about-vasectomies)

+1 Dr Lackritz, Besides the whole sterilization thing, she is very nice and her bedside manner is great. I’d say she’d be a better fit for CF folk that are 30+.

A Philadelphia based OBGYN states, "all of the general OB/Gyns at Jefferson will do a procedure for people choosing to be child-free". This OBGYN will soon be moving to Tampa and will be added to the list when we recieve confirmation of her practice location.

[Karen Tang, MD](https://axiawh.com/providers/dr-karen-tang-center-for-womens-surgery-axia-womens-health/) - I'm a minimally invasive Gynecologic surgeon in the Philadelphia suburbs. Another physician who is listed in the Childfree doctors list told me about the group, and suggested I request to be added. I've always happily provided sterilizations and hysterectomies to childfree patients without questioning their decisions. I fully believe in patient autonomy, and that people know their own minds and reproductive choices. I perform laparoscopic salpingectomies for sterilization, and laparoscopic hysterectomy for those with issues like abnormal bleeding, fibroids, adenomyosis, painful periods, etc. I also have a particular passion for caring for transgender and non-binary patients.

+1 Dr Tang, Dr. Karen Tang of Axia Women’s Health in King of Prussia, PA, is INCREDIBLE. She’s already on the list but I noticed that there weren’t any testimonials. She is incredibly thorough and only does bisalps now since that is being recognized as the gold standard. I am 22F and she didn’t even ask me why I wanted the surgery, just asked me if I had found her through Reddit or tik tok and when I commented on that she said that if I took the time to find her and schedule an appointment then I clearly knew what I wanted. I believe she is willing to operate on anyone 21+. I’ve never felt so affirmed in my life! Surgery booked for late April it was so easy.

+1 Dr Tang, I’m 26 and, in the first 10 minutes of my appointment with Dr Tang at Main Line Health in King of Prussia, PA, got approved for a bisalp next month. She’s not personally CF but she only sees GYN patients, not OB, and she was SO sweet, supportive, and competent, so I’d highly recommend her.

+1 Dr Tang, I'm 30, non-binary, single, and often very uncomfortable dealing with "women's health" because I get misgendered constantly. Dr. Tang took the time to ask my pronouns and was 100% respectful of my identity. She also affirmed that wanting to stay on birth control for menstrual suppression even after sterilization was normal. On top of doing bisalps, she will also remove any endometriosis she finds and deal with fibroids while she's in there, making it an extremely comprehensive procedure. 12 out of 10, great care.

[Victor L. Carpiniello, MD](https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/victor-carpiniello?fadf=PennMedicine) Vasectomy. 30yo, committed partnership for 6 years, childfree (no kids). Statement of experience: Efficient. Wait time for procedure was about 2 months out -- doctor only schedules surgical procedures for Thursday mornings. I took the earliest booking available.

[Dr Jie Xu with Main Line Obstetrics and Gynecology at Riddle Hospital in Media, PA](https://www.mainlinehealth.org/find-a-doctor/jie-xu?source=dL-providers). I (29F) had my bilateral salpingectomy with Dr Xu yesterday. He has been extremely helpful throughout the entire process. My regular OB within the practice, Dr. Kathryn Lupo, has always been respectful of my being CF, with zero judgement or nudges otherwise. She let me know about the process for the bilateral salpingectomy and that my insurance would cover it if that was an option I'd like to explore I never in a million years would've thought it could be covered!! She then referred me to Dr. Xu, who performs the surgery in their practice/hospital. Dr Xu explained the surgery and recovery process to me very clearly, answered my so's questions over the phone and always followed up with me when I left messages or questions for him at the office. He did give me the information on regret within age groups, but always followed by "I know you are very sure of your decision, but I have to say this at the appointments". Scheduling was easy, the hospital staff were all very nonjudgmental and spoke highly of Dr. Xu. He made sure to come see me after surgery and went out to talk to my so (who couldn't come in with me due to covid protocols) even though he had back to back procedures. I cannot believe what a great experience this has been and hope this helps someone else looking for a Dr they can trust!

Dr. Janet Ko, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A doctor from my college’s health center made many calls in order to find her for me: * https://providers.einstein.edu/provider/Janet+Ko/1451615 approval for bilateral salpingectomy for 21F, no kids * Super friendly and professional. I told her that I wanted the procedure done, and she approved it with no questions asked, except a routine “You are sure you want this procedure done?” * Consultation was in March. I was scheduled to have it done April 20th, 2020, but the pandemic caused a postponement of elective surgeries. In early May, Dr. Ko personally called to say I can come in for surgery May 28th, 2020. I would have gone except I was moving to California (where I got the procedure done in July 2020).

Dr. Robert Dein - Axia Women's Health/Main Line Women's Healthcare Malvern / Bryn Mawr, PA (Philadelphia suburbs) I just got a bilateral salpingectomy performed by Dr. Dein yesterday at Bryn Mawr hospital. My initial consultation appointment was only 10 days earlier and I had only had to wait 2-3 weeks to get my consultation appointment after my first call. At my consultation appointment, I was prepared to go in with guns blazing and I brought my boyfriend as backup, but one of the first things the doctor said was "I'm not here to tell you how to live." He asked me a few quick questions about other forms of birth control I'd tried but it was clear he wasn't trying to stop me or make me second-guess my decision. For the remainder of the appointment he just described the surgery and explained the recovery process to me. His office called me the next day to set up the surgery and I got scheduled for the very next week. It was only about 4 weeks between my first call to his office and having the surgery done. Note, however that I am 36 so I can't be 100% sure whether he would be quite as open to doing the surgery on someone much younger. All in all I had a very good experience!

**Phoenixville**

[Dr. Jeffrey Lee Rosenblum, M.D.](http://www.rosenblumurology.com/) (No-Needle No-Scalpel Vasectomy). Note: He now works for the Penn State Health system. I did an initial consult with him for a vasectomy, got approved pretty much instantaneously with the usual questions about marital status, kids, you sure you don't want kids. I was unable to have him perform the procedure due to losing my insurance because of a COVID layoff. The uninsured cost is astronomical - PSH's chargemaster has a no scalpel vasectomy at over $7,000.

[Dr. Christine J. Sigal, MD](https://axiawh.com/providers/sigal-christine/). Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. 35, married, no kids. The experience was unbelievable from start to finish. While I came to my initial appointment prepared, and while my age of 35 may have been on my side, I was respected and felt I didn’t have to plead my case, I just explained why I felt this was the best option for me, that I understood it was permanent, and a decision I wanted to be able to make for myself. Dr. Sigal is incredibly professional, unbelievably skilled (she performed an unrelated surgery about a year ago that went seamlessly), and the very definition of down to earth. She has an unparalleled bedside manner. Dr. Sigal was not only an exceptional surgeon, she was also my advocate throughout the entire process, and made it nothing short of a pleasure. (I paid $200 out of pocket with Aetna POS insurance, another plus!)

**Pittsburgh**

[Carl O. Bruning, III, M.D. Urologist, Suburban Urologic Associates, Monroeville and Jefferson Hills](http://www.suburbanurologic.com/physicians.shtml#Bruning)

+1 Dr. Bruning. He does scalpel-free without hassling about family situation at all.

+1 Dr. Bruning. Dr. Justin P. Isariyawongse also does scalpel-free ones without hassle.

Dr. Jeffrey Cohen in the Pittsburgh, PA area. He asked a few common sense questions and ensured I was positive that I wanted the procedure (27, unmarried, no kids) and beyond that gave no pushback. He listened to my answers, respected them, and then commenced the procedure. For what it’s worth, he did a very efficient and good job as well. 5/5 stars.

Dr. Thomas at St Clair Hospital's department of urology. I'm a 25 year old male and he approved the procedure after only a couple questions. I had the procedure today and it was a great experience.

[Dr Grace Ferguson, MD MPH](https://findcare.ahn.org/Grace-P-Ferguson) Allegheny Women's Health Federal North Medical Office Building (Primary) 1307 Federal St, Suite B201 Pittsburgh, PA 15212, (412) 359-3355. LGBTQ+ friendly. Jan 2023. Bilateral salpingectomy completed 32-year-old trans redditor. Other friends have gotten gender affirming hysterectomies with Dr. Ferguson. Her clinic and residents were all very affirming, easy going, and demonstrated great care for my health with no questioning of my choice. 

+1 Dr Ferguson, I'm a 24 year old woman, single, no kids. No BINGOs, asked a few questions and then approved me for a bilateral salpingctomy, which I received yesterday, wahoo!

[Gregory Halenda, M.D., F.A.C.S Urologist, Suburban Urologic Associates, Monroeville and Jefferson Hills](http://www.suburbanurologic.com/physicians.shtml) - Same practice as Dr. Bruning above. Asked a few questions but no hassle at all.

[Dr. Sheila Ramgopal](https://alleghenyreproductive.com/) at Allegheny Reproductive Health Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Surgery took place at Magee Women's Hospital. Hysterectomy, 29f, childfree, lesbian, unmarried, in a relationship. Dr. Sheila is AMAZING! During our phone consult I talked about my painful periods/heavy bleeding that was sometimes debilitating enough to cause me to miss work, life, etc., but was honest that my symptoms were not nearly as bad as many people's (never passed out, been hospitalized, etc.). They approved me for a hysterectomy (removal of uterus/cervix/tubes) with no bingos, pushback, or pressure to try birth control first. They answered my myriad questions and discussed the (relatively minimal) risks. The also perform other sterilizations like bisalp. Very LGBT+ friendly. Procedure was only ~$250 through BCBS FEP.

[Dr Jay Herman](https://www.jayhermanmd.com/), PA 36 and child-free No-scalpel vasectomy I called him on a Friday and he got me in the following Tuesday for the consult. Explained the procedure, asked "are you sure?" and accepted my response, no questions asked. Procedure booked for the following Wednesday, in and out in 20 minutes, recovered in 4 days. When talking after the procedure and complimenting him on his professionalism and lack of judgement, he said "I trust adults to make adult decisions about their reproductive health. It's not my place to question another adult's decisions." A+++

[Dr. Colleen Krajewski](https://www.obgyn.pitt.edu/people/colleen-krajewski-md). Bilateral Salpingectomy, 23yo.

[Erin L. Rhinehart, MD](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Erin+Lyn+Rhinehart/1321709) (tubal ligation). Firmly believes a woman can make the choice for sterilization without being questioned and especially without partner approval.

+1 Dr Rhinehart - Bilateral Salpingectomy. 26/F, Married, No children. Dr. Rhinehart is wonderful to deal with and very open to sterilization. She only cares about what the patient needs and is not interested in the patient's partner's opinions. She is very knowledgeable and understands the major statistical difference of sterilization regret percentages between childfree women and women who already have children. After a direct and clear conversation, she agreed and was impressed to see my Sterilization Binder after our conversation.

+1 Dr Rhinehart, OP consulted with her and was approved, but unfortunately the doctor went on maternity leave before completing sterilisation. Dr Kelly M. DiMattio completed sterilisation for OP at 21yo. 

+1 Dr Rhinehart, She performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me (23, F, no kids) just yesterday (just in time for the bad news). During my consult, she asked me why I want this procedure- I told her the obvious, like I don't want kids, have no interest in pregnancy, and I told her that I was in a long term relationship and my partner doesn't want kids either - she said "I don't care about what he wants - this is YOUR body. As long as this is what YOU want, that is good enough for me". My surgery couldn't have gone smoother. I am so grateful for her.

+1 Dr Rhinehart, She is a great doctor, truly cares about what her patient wants for themselves, and she did everything to make me feel as comfortable as possible going into the OR. She never once told me I’m too young to make this decision for myself or that I will change my mind about kids when I get older. She works with UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center). Bilateral Salpingectomy 22F. 

[Dr. Michelle Harvison](https://www.advancedwomenscareofpgh.com/harvison) at Advanced Womens Care in Pittsburgh Pa. I believe that Dr. Peske is already on the list but my experience is with a different doctor from the same practice. I spoke with Dr. Harvison last year about getting a salpingectomy, she recommended I wait until my IUD was ip then they could do the surgery and put a new IUD on at the same time. I had initially agreed. With the recent over turn of Roe V. Wade I had asked that we move this up regardless of the IUD. Dr. Harvison signed off but asked me for my reasoning to which I replied. She reaffirmed that I was 100% sure and signed off on surgery. Dr. Harvison only spoke to me one time about "making sure this was right for me." She did not try to talk me out of this at any point. She was extremely supportive and gave me all the pros and cons and all options I would have in the future if I did change my mind. Dr. Harvison was the one to perform the surgery. She came and saw me before surgery to explain each step to me and the healing process. All the nurses at St. Clair hospital were extremely helpful and did not try to talk me out of my decision or bingo me. They were great practitioners. We are as yet unclear if Dr Harvison will go straight to sterilisation for a new patient. 

[Dr. Jay B. Herman](https://www.noscalpelvasectomy.com/) - o scalpel vasectomy. 30 without children and unmarried, he asked 0 questions of me, just gave me a brief rundown of the procedure, asked if I had questions, and set up an appointment to get it done.

[Amir Toussi, MD](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Amir+Toussi/1324142) -  Vasectomy, scalpel-free. PA asked me questions about health history, then made sure I knew that vasectomies are permanent and that I was sure I didn't want kids. Whole first appointment was 20 minutes. Surgery was 15 minutes and Dr Toussi didn't shame or question my decision

[David M. Badway, MD](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/David+M.+Badway/1322770). Just saw him this week for my annual and remembered that I’ve been meaning to send a request to you guys ever since someone told me about this list. Dr. Badway performed my tubal in January of 2020 at Magee Women’s Hospital in Pittsburgh. I was 26 and single at the time. He was a bit hesitant at the start of our discussion, but I was persistent, explained all of my reasoning to him, and demonstrated that I understood what I was asking. After proving to him that I clearly had put thought into this decision, he was willing to go forward with the surgery. Post surgery, my scars are so minimal I barely even know they exist and are absolutely not noticeable to anyone but myself. At my appointment this week, his only comments on my tubal were asking how I was dealing with the endometriosis he found during surgery and how well the scars had begun to fade. Very friendly with a respectful bedside manner. Would highly recommend.

Charlie Miller in Pittsburgh PA, Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. As I mentioned before I’m 27 (28 in September). My doctor didn’t question me or my decision. No one on my team questioned me. Everyone made me feel extremely comfortable and well taken care of.

He goes by Dr. Vasquez. He is with Century Medical Associates in the Pittsburgh, PA region. I am 28 YO, married, have no children, and didn’t encounter any bingos during my appointments. I waited 1 week for my consultation appointment, signed the consent form that makes you wait 30 days, and had my procedure within 90 days.

[Dr Kelly Dimattio —Pittsburgh, PA](https://www.obgyn.pitt.edu/people/kelly-m-dimattio-md-phd). Gave me a bilateral salpingectomy at 21 with no kids. Asked a couple questions to make sure I was set in my decision but was overall very respectful and supportive of my child free status. Got a surgery scheduled soon after the consult and it went smoothly, highly recommend her!

+1 Dr. Kelly DiMatteo, MD located in Pittsburgh, PA. Bilateral salpingectomy at age 22. I was faced with no bingos, and she completed the procedure without hassle. 

[Dr. Rebecca Waltner-Toews](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Rebecca+I+Waltner-Toews/1324752) Female, 26, laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. I met with Dr. Waltner-Toews once asking for a tubal ligation and she listened to me and ended up approving a bilateral salpingectomy instead for more effective cancer prevention as a precaution. She was very kind, thoughtful and I didn't have to go through any special hoops getting approval for my surgery on my first visit with her. Dr. Pritha Workman did the procedure though at UPMC Magee and was also incredibly kind.

[Dr. Ingrid Wecht](https://pghgynobcom.wordpress.com/about/). Double salpingectomy I'm 28 years old, unmarried, no prior children. I actually had my consult with a different doctor who approved me, but she made me kind of uncomfortable so I asked for a different one and Dr. Wecht was willing to take on my case and perform my surgery without meeting me beforehand, so I guess the other doctor's willingness was good enough for her. No bingos, but I only met her while I was in pre-op right before the surgery and basically went "And you're absolutely sure you don't want kids? Okay." Procedure went well, and though I didn't speak with her much, I appreciate that she trusted me enough to know what I want without feeling the need to grill me with questions.

[Dr. Kathleen Huang](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Kathleen+Y+Hwang/1326843). No scalpel vasectomy done at 25 years old, single, no kids. I requested a vasectomy consult last summer, with about a 2 week wait before an appointment was available. At the appointment, one of Dr. Huang's assistants asked me if I understood that this was a permanent procedure and if I was sure that I didn't ever want any kids. After I said yes to both of those, there was no more questioning or pressure. She did a quick exam to make sure that she could find the vas on both sides and that everything was in the right place for the procedure to be feasible, then set up another appointment a month out for the surgery. Day of, it took under an hour from arriving at the hospital to leaving post op. Total cost was $1,250 with a 2 year payment plan option available (no interest).

Performed bilateral vasectomy, asked a few questions about my certainty and wife's approval and required a consent form signed and returned the day of procedure. Very friendly and non-judgmental, my age (31) did not seem to be a factor as both I and my wife (28) we positive of our decision. Accepts multiple different insurances, but if not covered, cost is $850 as of 2018/2019

[Dr Kristine Leaman](https://towerhealth.org/providers/kristine-m-leaman-md). She just did a bilateral tubal ligation with clamps/rings/whatever after I asked only once, no bingos, did ask if I was sure once in the pre-op appointment but I took that as a confirmation of understanding rather than a bingo. I’m 29, married, and happily CF. NB this member recently had a laparoscopic hysterectomy with Dr Leaman.

+1 Dr Kraft, He just did my bilaterial salpingectomy today. I am 34 (33 as of consultation), unmarried, and childfree. He didn't pester me with any questions at all about my relationship status or insist on exploring alternative birth control options (I have never had a IUD and never wanted one). He just immediately agreed to do the surgery. His exact comment was that someone at my age should know what she wants, so there is a possibility he might ask more questions to a younger patient, but overall, seems very open.

**Scranton**

Only performs bilateral salpingectomies. Had some trouble with the Nurse Practitioner, as you are required to see one before seeing Dr. Plucknett herself if coming in as a new patient. Nurse Practitioner tried to talk me (21F) out of it and flat out told me it's not something they do there. Dr. Plucknett called me the next day after my consultation and apologized and made me another appointment with her. Dr. Plucknett asked the standard questions about health history and if I had considered other BC options and if I understood how permanent sterilization is. Definitely come informed. After seeing how much research I had done on this and how long I've been considering it, she scheduled me (again, 21 F!) for a bilateral salpingectomy, in under a month!

[Lisa Jaramillo](http://www.phacommonwealth.com/physicians-health-alliance/physicians/jaramillo-lisa-do-2734.aspx) (bilateral salpingectomy). Note: She was hesitant but ended up approving me, 23F. Arrive very well informed. She mentioned she would rather know a patient for a year or more before approving them; if this is something you want but are a bit younger and/or are going to wait a year or two she will probably be more open than when I met with her for the first time.

[Dr. Kristine McNulty] (https://www.cwhphysiciannetwork.net/doctors-providers/mcnulty-kristine-m-md-5484). Approved 30/F for sterilization (bilateral salpingectomy). Mentioned that she might have given OP a harder time if she was younger, though.

[John Drozdick, M.D., FACOG](https://g.co/kgs/V9NfBC). I at first asked for a tubal ligation, but he then agreed to perform a bilateral salpingectomy without any issues or bad opinions shoved down my throat.

**East Stroudsburg**

[Melody M. Reynolds, MD](https://www.lvhn.org/doctors/melody-reynolds) 179 Independence Rd, East Stroudsburg, PA 18301, she is an absolute sweetheart and I love her. I didn’t get bingoed at all. She is very accepting and progressive and happy to help women have reproductive freedom. The entire medical team I dealt with was absolutely amazing and the surgery was great, and so far recovery has been really easy! I said when I want my periods stopped forever I’m coming back! And she said “I gotchu”. She said her colleague made a comment like “you’re doing a tubal on a 22 year old?” And her clapback was like yes I am, she is competent to make her own medical decisions!

+1 Dr Reynolds, I underwent a D&C, ablation and bilateral salpingectomy. I had had a history of period issues with no discernable cause. The standard birth control medication side effects were not healthy either so I sought her care towards sterilization and ending my periods, I had also expressed my desire to be child free. She readily agreed on the first appointment, though due to my age (22F) and my history of issues with menstruation she ordered some additional tests. She is pro LGBTQ and serves on a diversity and inclusion board. I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking sterilization. Dr, Reynolds actually listens to her patients and spends more than 15 minutes with you to get a proper gauge of you as a person.

+1 Dr Colalillo. I'm in my early 30s, single and childfree. She was completely supportive, no bingos, got me on track for surgery right away despite having only seen me once before (for a separate issue). I went in wanting a tubal ligation, but she pointed out the bisalp option to me. She went through the standard pre-sterilization questions as part of the surgical consent form, but I never felt like she was pressuring me, just confirming my choice.

[Damon Hoffmann, DO](https://whs.org/physicians/hoffmann-damon-do/) No-Scalpel Vasectomy (local anesthesia, though his partner will do the procedure under full anesthesia) 30 years old; single; CF Great experience. He asked basic questions during consultation, didn't press further, and scheduled my surgery the next month. Procedure was smooth and professional, with no complications and quick recovery.

[Dr. Lori DelGaudio](http://www.ob-gyn-associates.com), 545 North River Street Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18702. Bilateral salpingectomy at 27, I had asked about the procedure previously and she said she would like to wait until I’m 30 but would still do it regardless of whether I had kids or was married. I just asked again a year later and she agreed but really did drill me on “are you ABSOLUTELY SURE you won’t change your mind?” As long as you are persistent, informed, and aware that it is permanent she is agreeable to sterilization at younger ages. 570-288-6616.

[Dr. Christine Kansky, MD](https://axiawh.com/providers/kansky-christine/), West Chester, Pennsylvania. Bilateral Salpingectomy for a 33F. Dr. Kansky is incredible: supportive, positive, affirming, the whole nine yards. I scheduled a consult with her about a bilateral salpingectomy, which she performed on me about two months later, and she didn't bat an eye. Said that it was my body and my choice and that it's no business of hers to tell me or anyone what to do with their bodies, no matter how many children they have had (including zero). Never asked me about whether or not I had a partner and what they thought. It was truly just between me as a patient and her as my doctor.

**Wyomissing** 

Dr. Heidi Strieb in Wyomissing,PA. I had a bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy performed by her. She is a surgeon as well as a OB/GYN. She is awesome! I am currently 23 and childfree. There was no pushback from her, she just explained the risks and said: “it’s your choice.” Highly recommend her! She was great. It is unclear if Dr Strieb's partner is childfree/sterilisation friendly so we recommend members to book in with Dr Strieb specifically. 

**York** 

[Dr. Priya G. Patel](https://www.wellspan.org/provider-search/profile/Priya-Patel-MD-Obstetrics-Gynecology-York-PA/29541) from York, PA was excellent. No bingos whatsoever outside of what was required to do my bisalp, and no cost after insurance either (I have CIGNA). Highly, highly recommend if you want a doctor who listens and takes you seriously.

[Dr. Jason Bonslaver](http://www.yturology.com/). Scalpel vasectomy, no clips. Age: 31, married, both childfree/DINK. Referred from Primary care, initial consult went smoothly and was approved instantly. They did ask if I was married and had any kids, I told them "we don't want kids" and their reply was "That's okay, kids aren't for everyone." Rubber stamped approval. Wait time from consult to procedure was 3.5 months. My OOP costs with insurance were $105, but their full uninsured price (as of Oct 2021) was $1,200. Note, Dr. Bonslaver did say he might be more hesitant to sterilize younger patients, but had no issue with me (31).

[Elizabeth Andes, M.D.](https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Elizabeth+Andes/1815169) - Agreed to do a tubal ligation on a 24 year old female. No questions asked about my age and if I had any children. I was told it was "my choice" and she "does not like to dictate what a woman does with her body." I was asked if I was sure only once and I was given one scenario of "If you found the most perfect guy in the world out there and he wanted kids, would you have a problem with that?" No other questions were asked about my decision. However, due to being on Medicaid, I have to wait at least 30 days between signing the consent forms and the actual surgery. Very nice, very laid-back doctor overall though! 

+1 Dr Andes, I scheduled one pre-op visit with her in November and got my procedure done within a few months of that (could have been as soon as the next month, but I wanted time to prepare). At the pre-op visit she didn't need to see my No Rugrats binder, and she was aware that Reddit has her listed as a go-to OBGYN in York. She said that she's proud to be known as a safe doctor for people to see and that she's 100% for women making their own decisions about their bodies. She educated me on my options for birth control, and though she obviously suggested less invasive options first, she had no problem with discussion on more permanent options. She did say that she doesn't remove the ovaries unless absolutely necessary because the hormones they produce are pretty important to prevent some early onset health conditions (osteoporosis, increased risk of menopause-related morbidity) but she was happy to agree to do a bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy on me. She reminded me that it's permanent procedure and went over the risks, possible complications. She palpated my belly to make sure that with my weight (I'm a big gal) she'd be able to get through my fat layer without issues. 

[Dr. Smith-Leed](https://www.wellspan.org/provider-search/profile/Lauren-SmithLeed-MD-Obstetrics-Gynecology-York-PA/3095), WellSpan OB/GYN - Queen St. 2050 S. Queen St. York, Pennsylvania, USA 17403  (717) 812-2316. Great experience. Dr. Smith-Leed approved me for a bisalp readily, did not give me any bingos, and didn't ask about my relationship status, though I volunteered on my initial paperwork that I'm polyamorous. I got approved at 28 YO, had the procedure completed 6 weeks later at 29 YO. I highly recommend Dr. Smith-leed, she was confident, caring, approachable. **USE WITH CAUTION** not yet verified by a childfree person.

Childfree, unmarried 25y/o Female. Story: went in for a sterilization consult. Said that he believes that this is a women's choice and he has no problem doing it. Stated that he did have slight concerns about my age due to high risk of regret, but he's done it on women as young as 20. He said that his office will usually see women twice in 1 month, once for the consult and 1 a month later to make sure that they want a permanent procedure. Never felt spoken down to at all, I was concerned that the "regret talk" would be condescending/paternalistic, but it was the opposite. He really does care about the long-term wellbeing of his patients.

Doctor did not once bingo me. He only asked once if I was sure I never wanted children, only asked once if my husband was in agreement (and took my word for it, did not try to ask husband directly). The day of the surgery he showed up while they were prepping me, cracked a (fantastic) joke, and when I woke up he was there telling me how great everything went. I'm 6 days post op and healing beautifully.

(30F, November 2018. Went as new patient and had a brief discussion before scheduling a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. I mentioned he was the 12th doctor I've asked and I was ready for an argument, and he said that pro-choice means pro-ALL-choices. He's on the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood and is just fabulously nice.)

Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 28yo childfree. First consult to surgery took 4 months, he did give some push back and kept highlighting less permanent options, but his core belief is "your body, your choice."

+1 Bisalp on 27-year-old CF woman Sept 2022. Doctor wanted to make sure I knew what I was choosing. The surgery date was two months after the consult, probably because of scheduling issues.

**Beaufort** 

[Dr. Kevin Blau](https://www.bjhchs.org/locations/port-royal-ob) with Port Royal OB/GYN (1264 Ribaut Rd Suite #200 Beaufort, South Carolina 29902. I had my initial consultation in September 2022 and the follow up in November 2022. At the initial, he discussed all possible avenues for birth control to ensure I was informed. He will have a thorough discussion but will not deny any options as he believes everyone has the right to their own bodily autonomy. He will schedule a follow up after a few months to give you "time to think and be sure". At the second appointment, we briefly went over everything from the first, asked if I was totally sure, and then we did bloodwork and signed forms. He prefers to remove the entire tube as opposed to burning or clipping as it is the most effective method. The surgery was preformed laparoscopically at Beaufort Memorial Hospital on January 18th 2023. He happily took before and after photos as I requested and overall is very respectful to me and my decisions and is very responsive to questions and discussions. The only drawback was the overall time it took from consultation to the actual surgery but this was in part due to his limited availability to preform actual surgeries (only Wednesdays). I had this procedure fully paid for through TriCare as I am active duty military so I cannot speak on what types of insurance they take or how much the procedure would've cost otherwise.

I am an unmarried 23 year old women. Doctor Benson performed my tubal ligation when I was 22, a week before Roe v Wade was overturned. He gave me a little push back to make sure this was what I wanted for myself but after one visitation he agreed and scheduled my surgery less than two weeks later. He was very polite and encouraged the staff not to question my choices as I was going into my surgery

Bisalp on 39-year-old CF redditor. She loves doing surgeries! Her only concern was informing me that without taking birth control my periods could get funky. It is not clear that this doctor will do sterilization on younger redditors, so be warned.

Dr. Jessica Tarleton, MD, MPH You can find me (make an appointment) at the family planning clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, SC. At MUSC we accept almost all forms of insurance that SC provides including Medicaid and Medicare. (Can confirm on their website.). The lower limit of age for which I will do a sterilization is 21. I am a board certified OBGYN and did a fellowship in complex family planning so also happy to do IUDs in teens and young women if they can’t access them elsewhere. I am LGBTQ friendly but still learning. I’m happy to learn from you what you need. I don’t do gender affirming surgeries or medications, but happy to work with other healthcare providers that do.

[Dr. Alexandra Rowin - OB/GYN](https://bit.ly/2XW13DH): MUSC Health - Women's Health at Cannon. Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 23 y/o nulliparous woman (*virgin at the time/never used and opposed using alternative birth controls) via SC Medicaid [Family Planning]. Approved on first try and signed consent form that day...surgery was promptly scheduled for 1 month later. No bingos. No "interview". Caring, respectful, and informative. Doesn't have a minimum age for sterilization. I highly recommend her not only for sterilization but any gynecological needs! She will exceed your expectations.

Also stated that she does bilateral salpingectomies. Very understanding and non-judgemental.

Dr Angela Richardson Dempsey-Fanning, MD, MPH at MUSC Women’s Health on Cannon St. No bingos or pushback, I signed consent forms the day of my consultation and my insurance had been contacted with the advice that this procedure was deemed “medically necessary” before I even left the office. Highly recommend her! 29F bilateral salpingectomy. 

[Dr. Rachel Powell](https://providers.muschealth.org/sc/mount-pleasant/rachel-pemberton-powell-md-bs) at MUSC in Charles, SC. I am 36, married, and had my bilateral salpingectomy yesterday. I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Powell. From the first time I met with her about long term birth control, sterilization surgery, and my reasons, options - she has been knowledgeable and respectful. She did her job, meaning that she asked me at all my visits if this is still something I wanted to pursue, as she is legally asked to do to avoid a regretful patient situation in the future. But she never belittled or discredited my feelings or bingoed me or put any sort of pressure one way or another. She was very professional during the entire situation and was on board with me doing whatever I wanted to do with my body.

Upon further discussions, he has tentatively agreed provided that the user gain approval from a psychiatrist say that they are of sound mind.

-1 Dr. Addy. Disrespectful, sexist, and offensive. Doctor required a "long discussion" in which he bingoed a married 34-year-old redditor, demanded she get a psych eval, pushed IUD and Nexplanon, and made a "sad face" when the redditor refused and said "As a father, it’s not something I’d want my daughters doing". Because the redditor's husband is sterilized, he did not ask what the husband thought, instead opting for "what if your husband dies and you connect with your high school sweetheart and he’s never had kids and wants to have biological children with you?” See this doctor well warned that you will be treated with misogyny and disrespect.

[Dr. Thomas C. Austin](www.lexingtonwomenscaresandhills.com) at Lexington Women’s Care Sandhills in Columbia, South Carolina. He performed a bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation in September 2022. I am 28 years old, married, and child-free (zero children, zero past pregnancies). Easy, no bingo consult. He did ask if my husband had considered a vasectomy instead but understood when I said I wanted it for myself. After a quick ultrasound to check my anatomy, he signed off. The total process (as an existing patient) took about a month and a half. The hospital required a $500 surgery deposit due one week prior to surgery (no option to include it in a payment plan) plus a co-pay on the day of the procedure.

I had a consultation with Dr. Marguet and scheduled my surgery with him; however, he had to leave for a personal emergency just before my procedure and Dr. Wynia filled in for him and did my procedure instead.

He was fully supportive of my choice to get sterilized the entire time, and even agreed with my comment that kids are gross and awful.

When I met Dr. Wynia on the day of my surgery he asked if I had kids, if I was married, and how long, if my wife and I were on the same page about not wanting kids, and told me to consider the vasectomy permanent.

Performed for 9 month long periods and birth control was not an option. Had diagnostic lap first then 2 months later had hysterectomy. 2 month wait time once we decided. Cost was 3,000. Super friendly and understanding. She was a firm believer that other doctors shouldn’t let their beliefs surrounding fertility keep me from having a hysterectomy at a young age since I was miserable.

+1 [Dr Nguyen](https://www.selfregional.org/providers/location/greenwood-obstetrics-gynecology/), Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy procedure was completed Feb 2023 on a 26 year old single female with no previous children, miscarriages, or abortions. This was the first doctor I went to in my journey. Made the appointment late December and was seen in mid January. Physician only asked if I was 100% sure within 2 minutes of talking. She said that she has no right in preventing someone from wanting surgery. I was prepared with reasons why I wanted it, but she never asked. Birth control history did not matter despite only being on it for 2 months my whole life with no medical issues. Entering to leaving hospital took 6 hours. I paid ~$4,200.00 with insurance. Coming off of anesthesia was rough, so a nurse played music off of their phone to relax me. Staff was so kind.

*EDIT: In keeping Dr. Marik on this list, it has reminded me to look her up now that some time has passed. I believe I have found her at her current location in Butte, MT.
SCL Health Medical Group - Butte OB-Gyn 305 W Porphyry St Ste 200, Butte, MT 59701. Phone: 406-496-3627.  I will add this information to the Montana list so that those in the area can find it. This can all be edited into a proper form once her location has been confirmed.*

**Summerville** 

Dr. Jennifer Heinemann at Lowcountry Women's Specialists is the best! I went to her when I was 39 asking for her to tie my tubes. I have no children, and I don't desire to have children. I do also have some other female health issues (endometriosis), so she was able to help with those issues as well. If you are someone who knows that you don't want kids and you don't want to get stuck in a bad situation with these new laws, then you should look into seeing her. She is located in Summerville, SC and she is a very kind, compassionate, and thorough doctor. I am so grateful I don't have to worry about birth control pills anymore!!! NB OP advises that this doctor is open to sterilising 21+. NB prospective pts may get a couple of bingoes but this doctor should still move forward with the procedure. 

[Dr. Ronnie Givens](https://lowcountrywomen.com/) Summerville, South Carolina. 28F. I went through Tricare. He was AMAZING. No bingos, didn't ask "how my husband felt about it," approved me right away. This was my first time asking for the procedure.

[Dr. Beth Cook](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/beth-cook-370557): Women's Health Partners, 75 Springview Ln, Summerville, SC 29485, (Approved my bilateral salpingectomy on first consult, no hesitation or questioning my childfree status, and I'm 33.)

[Dr. William “Bo” Reeves](https://lowcountrywomen.com/my-physicians/) - I’m 25, no kids, was on BC and have a partner and Dr. Reeves agreed to perform tubal ligation during my first visit. No bingos, no awkwardness, and you can tell he’s just a genuinely great person and doctor.

**Sumter** 

Dr. Jill McLeod Prisma Health OB/GYN Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital 115 N. Sumter Street, Suite 200 Sumter, SC 803-775-8351. Bilateral Salpingectomy. Almost 1 month from the first consult date. She had zero issues with doing the bi-salp, we even talked hysterectomy but I opted out due to my insurance being terrible right now. She was aware of her name being out there as pro-sterilization and was not bothered at all. During the whole process I had nothing but support from Dr. McLeods practice and then today from the staff members at Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital.

###SOUTH DAKOTA

**Aberdeen** 

[Dr. Breanne Mueller](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/breanne-mueller) - (605) 226-5500 -  Tubal Ligation Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am a technically single  childfree 25 year old woman. I was actually approved for the procedure at 23 years old while in a 5 year relationship with a man but delayed it due to my partner disapproving of it. I have MN Blue Cross Blue Shield. The procedure was $5,500 but I am paying $800 out of pocket. This doctor *may* insist on trying LARCs before sterilisation, members should be prepared to explore other options if they do not wish to experience this. 

**Rapid City**

[Dr Angela Anderson](https://rapidcitymedicalcenter.com/rcmc_providers/angela-k-anderson-md/) practices at the Rapid City Medical Center. She does surgery out of the Black Hills Surgical Hospital. I had not seen her before I scheduled a consultation for a tubal, so I was not an existing patient. I made the appointment using their website. She did a pelvic exam and a Pap smear. She did not question my desire for sterilization in any way, all of her questions for me were health and medication related. She did explain that she will ONLY perform a salpingectomy, not a tubal ligation, and made it clear it can not be reversed. I told her that was what I preferred and she moved on. The procedure was laparoscopic with full anesthesia and Black Hills Surgical Hospital is a wonderful facility that provided a really good experience.  [Dr Anderson - Black Hills Surgical Hospital](https://bhsh.com/physicians/angela-anderson/) While they were prepping me for anesthesia I made a joke about having this done the same day the Roe decision came down and Dr Anderson made a comment about expecting to do a lot more of these procedures going forward because of Roe being struck down. So that comment on top of how nonchalant she was about doing the salpingectomy for a childless, brand new patient makes me think she’s going to be a good one to go to. 

[Dr. Mark Ballard](https://www.ballardgyn.com/), Ballard Gynecology, 208 Federal Ave., Rapid City, South Dakota, 57702 (IUD, Nexplanon, lap/robotic tubal ligations and salpingectomies. I don't believe he offers essure anymore)

Dr. Wesley Sufficool, DO - Surgical Solutions, Rapid City, SD. (605) 791-5553. My husband had a good experience with him getting a vasectomy at the age of 28 back in December. Dr. Sufficool performs a procedure that is non-reversible, as he removes a small amount of the vas tubes and cauterizes the ends. While talking with him, he was comfortable helping men of all ages, especially after marrying his second wife; he mentioned she never wanted kids and he was very on board with that. He's also very funny during the consultation to help put you at ease. Prices were reasonable and they take most insurances.

**Sioux Falls**

Dr. Annette Siewert, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Performed bilateral salpingectomy on child free, unmarried 26 year old in January 2022. Procedure done 2 weeks after consultation. Respectful during consultation. Offered different options but didn’t try to change my mind. Very busy so takes a while to get an appointment with her.

[Dr. Amy Kelly-Osdoba](http://www.sanfordhealth.org/find-a-doctor/amy-kelleyosdoba), Sanford Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1500 W 22nd St Suite 301, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57105 (Mirena)

[Dr Erica Shipper](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/erica-schipper) performed a tubal ligation on a 28F. Was willing to perform a bilateral salpingectomy but the patient was unable to accept this option for insurance reasons. 

+1 Dr Shipper Bilateral Salpingectomy I'm 24 years old, single, and childfree by choice. Both the nurse and the doctor were wonderful. They were completely supportive of my decision. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield for insurance and the procedure will be completely covered.

**Bristol**

[Dr. Haley Akin](https://m.facebook.com/people/Haley-Akin/100078973110599/), Bristol Gynecology and Obstetrics, 249 Midway Medical Park Ste 101, Bristol TN 37620 423-968-3033. Doctor reached out to us. Doctor is body-positive and treated a woman of size with respect and consideration.

From her Facebook page: “I am an OBGYN provider in the Tri-Cities area. (Bristol TN.) If you need reliable contraception – including IUDs and Nexplanon, please come see me! I always take new patients…I also do tubals/permanent sterilization if that’s what you prefer. You have the autonomy to choose the family YOU want. This is a scary time for all of us. “

In response to a query from a CF sub member: Would she sterilize a CF woman, and does she have an age limit? She said that will sterilize anyone who can willingly give consent, has carefully considered all options, and has been offered other options, such as IUDs and implants. She has to abide by all legal requirements of insurance companies.

+1 Dr Akin. "I'm a 25 year old unmarried female. During my appointment, Dr. Akin made me feel so comfortable and at-ease. She claimed it was "her job" to inform me of other types of birth control but when I said that I was sure about the procedure she asked me if I preferred a tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy. After discussing the options, she suggested we just go ahead with the bisalp so I'll have no more pregnancy anxiety!" Redditor is a larger woman and found Dr. Akin to be very body-positive.

**Chattanooga**: 

[Anand Shridharani, MD](https://www.erlanger.org/find-a-doctor/find-a-doctor?id=142). Vasectomy for 24yo .

[Dr. Kirk Brody](https://drbrodyobgyn.com/). Performed a ligation/ablation on a 20F.

[Dr. William Young](https://chimemorialmedicalgroup.org/www/physician-detail/123/view/23/chi-memorial-urology-associates/william-young--md). Performed vasectomy on a 26M. 

[Dr. Andrew Jones](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-andrew-jones-25bdf) Performed a bilateral salpingectomy and endometrial ablation on 33F. 

+1 Dr Jones, He completed an ovary-sparing hysterectomy on me. Removed my uterus, my fallopian tubes, and my cervix at my request. I explained to him that my periods have made me miserable for 20 years, I do not want to become pregnant under any circumstances given the Supreme Court ruling. He agreed, and specifically told me "If you don't want it for childbearing, you don't need to keep it. Simple as that." He did require me to have a smaller surgery first, an exploratory laparoscopy to ensure I had no endometriosis or cancer that would get in the way of the main surgery, and a D&C to clean my uterus out to reset the cycle. This was all required by the hospital's insurance and his malpractice insurance though, not him specifically. Then 6 weeks later I had my hysterectomy. He was amazing, straightforward, didn't sugar coat anything, never once asked me any BINGO questions. 38 years old, Married, NB and Straight, CF.

[Dr. Robbert Furr](http://www.womenssurgerycentertn.com/about-us/robert-furr-md.php) 866.899.0679

[Dr. Shevonda Sherrow.](https://www.innovativewomen.net/) Clinic address:2158 Northgate Park #300, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37415. Phone number: (423) 771-9680. I had a Bilateral Salpingectomy performed via laparoscopy, at age 23, with no children, and without being married. Though, I am engaged and have been with my partner for almost 9 years, which the doc was aware of. Dr. Sherrow is extremely lovely. I brought up to her that sterilization is my ultimate goal at my very first appointment with her and she had my sign consent forms that day. She only asked me why I didn't want kids once, and after I explained she stated that since I was 21, and of sound mind, she would do it, and got me consent forms to sign. I had a doctors fee of just under $600 prior to surgery that had to be paid before Aug. 13th of 2021, which I paid in full. The hospital did state that I will have to pay my deductible for the procedure, but both times I have called my insurance (before and after the surgery) they've said it will be covered 100% since it is preventative.  My insurance provider is Blue Cross Blue Shield. NB another member advises, Dr. Shevonda sherrow's staff told me it would take 2 or 3 visits to determine if I was a candidate for an IUD. They would not confirm if I would even be able to get one.

+1 Dr. Shevonda Sherrow in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She would have approved it on my first appointment but I wanted to take some time to think. During my second appointment, she okayed me for the procedure and got me scheduled. There was no fuss, no questions about any potential future husband, and no shaming whatsoever. Her and her staff have made me feel heard, seen, and understood - which is wild as a queer, autistic person. She will be performing the procedure at Erlanger Hospital in downtown Chattanooga. Erlanger also told me that I should not be responsible for any cost, especially because I have two modes of insurance. Also, she promised me pictures of my insides after the procedure.

+1 Dr. Sherrow. May 2023. Bisalp on 24-year-old redditor, without judgment.

[Dr Linda Yu](https://www.erlanger.org/find-a-doctor/find-a-doctor?id=1508) -  She did a bilateral salpingectomy for me last month. I am 25 years old. Not married. No kids. I asked last year & she suggested I try an IUD first. I had issues with it all year. She asked what I wanted to do. I said have my tubes removed. & she immediately scheduled IUD removal & bi sap. She said at 25, I am old enough to know what I want & to make decisions for my own body. Very kind & no judgment at all! Definitely recommend. NB another 21yo member advised that Dr Yu's team told her she was too young for an IUD. 

Dr. Kreg Jonson with rivercity women’s specialists. Chattanooga TN. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy plus cyst draining and fibroid removal. I am 35 F, married, child free. I had a great experience with Dr. Jonson. He gave me the option of tubal vs bisalp. Not once did he question my choice and made me feel very validated.

[Dr. Alicia Allen](https://galenmedical.com/allen-2-2/) at Galen Medical in Chattanooga, TN. I had to meet with a nurse first to do intake (regular gyno exam) and that took about 3 months to get an appt so that part sucked BUT once I met with Dr. Allen, I was able to schedule the surgery within a month! She had no qualms, but she had to list the risks of the surgery and do a survey to make sure I understood it was a permanent procedure. She said “im not here to talk you out of it. I just need to hear from you that you understand the potential risks.” 

**Clarksville** 

Dr Courtney Cabell, Bilateral Salpingectomy 22F, gave me no pushback.

Dr Tracy Coffey, QueenCityWomensHealth, Bilateral Salpingectomy, 36F, agreed the first time I requested with no judgment. As OP is 35+ people under 30 should use this doctor with caution. 

Dr. Dino DeLaurentis at Clarksville Urology 787 Weatherly Drive Suite 400 Clarksville, Tennessee 37043 (931)-291-9150. Dr. Dino performed a vasectomy for my 30 year old boyfriend, he’s childfree and unmarried. Dr. Dino asked him one time if he wanted kids, and didn’t press the issue.

[Dr. Brenda Snowman](http://www.ocoeeobgyn.com/Dr-Snowman.html) 2550 Business Park Drive NE Cleveland TN 37311. (423) 641-1783. Dr. Snowman referred a 24 year old woman for bilateral salpingectomy. She is not a surgeon, but is helpful and positive about referrals. She would prefer a patient to have been seen more than once before providing referral. NB Dr Snowman is closing her practice on July 31 and no longer taking patients. 

**Columbia** 

[Dr. Lisa Phillips](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/locations/vanderbilt-center-womens-health-columbia?utm_source=Yext) Columbia, Tennessee. 28, Single (long-term cohabiting w/ male partner), No Children. I did not get any bingos about being unmarried or nuparillous during my sterilization consultation with Dr. Phillips. She listened to my reasoning, ensured that I understood it was permanent, and then she gave a description of the procedure before getting me set up with her scheduler. She was very adamant about making sure women got the care they needed with everything going on after the RvW overturning.

**Dyersburg** 

Eugene Michael Finan, MD 1720 Woodlawn Avenue, Suite 1, Dyersburg, Tennessee 38024, USA Bilateral Salpingectomy (referred to it as Bilateral Tubal Ligation for insurance coding purposes) 21F, Engaged, CF 30 day medicaid wait period between consent and procedure. Asked why not IUD, told him I was scared of dilation/pregnancy along with not wanting children, & asked why not my partner, told him that doesn’t protect me from getting attacked, and he handed me the consent forms to sign after hearing those two answers. Did not ask about already having kids and I offered I was engaged willingly.

[Dr. Lane Williams, MD](https://www.womansclinicpa.com/) - Woman's Clinic PA Sterilized a childfree, unmarried 28 year old via a bilateral tubal ligation without any bingos. Just wanted me to be aware it was a permanent procedure (duh!), but emphasized that it was ultimately my decision to make. I got my tubes cauterized and cut, but I believe he also provides other options. Very friendly, informative, and respectful throughout the whole process.

[Alison Cronin](https://www.etsuhealth.org/find-a-doctor/obgyn/cronin.php), she practices in Johnson City and Elizabethton, TN. I'm 25 years old, single, never married, no children. I had tried for years to get a doctor to listen to me, and on a whim, I decided to try Alison. I explained my reasoning and struggle to the resident who came first, and the resident passed it on. She came in, told me I was old enough to know what I wanted, explained the procedure and risks, and made sure I was sure. 4 months after the consult, I was in surgery. It was a bit complicated due to my anatomy, but I healed quickly and felt amazing.

[Dr. Elisabeth McGaw](https://sofha.net/providers/elisabeth-mcgaw/) Kingsport, TN and Johnson City, TN I am a 30 year old, married, CF woman. Dr. McGaw was nonjudgmental and respected my desire for a bilateral salpingectomy.

Set up bi-salp surgery at the next appointment and completed it with no bingos throughout the whole process.

The doctor said: “This is irreversible. The number one issue with this surgery is regret. Are you sure?” When I confirmed, no more questions asked. I did say I would adopt if I ever changed my mind though, which may or may not have helped. 

[DR Natalie Prejean Blache](https://www.utmedicalcenter.org/doctors/natalie-p-blache-md/?fbclid=IwAR3on1o0ren0lKd6eTb5T9B7npY8pzkxF0iaglnh0LKuN73hVoQaADAAJ4E), University Women's Specialists, 1928 Alcoa Highway, Suite B-300 Knoxville, TN 37920.

[Dr. Rebecca Walker](https://parkwestmds.com/) ParkWest Women's Specialists 9314 Park West Blvd #100, Knoxville, TN 37923 (865) 690-7677, tubal ligation (cauterization) 39 at the time, single, no kids. Obviously I am a little older, so I cannot vouch for the fact that she would perform them on someone very young, but I will say that I was referred by a nurse at the local abortion clinic. I told her I had known since I was a teenager that I didn't want kids and she said OK. Her only question was Did I understand that it was permanent and that if I wanted to have children later the only way would be via IVF. I said yes and then she was called away for an emergency delivery. End of session. (Not sure what a bingo is, but no trying to talk me out of it). I didn't pay anything for the surgery, only a $25 copay the first visit. Be CAREFUL using this doctor if under 30, as the doctor may not be supportive.

Performed laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on 21F, single, and childfree woman. There were no bingos and immediately was approved for surgery. He specifically thanked me for bringing my sterilization binder and mentioned that it made his decision to do the surgery an easy one, so if you see him, make sure you’ve prepared a document on why you want to be sterilized. And the surgery was 100% covered by my insurance (Cigna) since I have reached my deductible!

No bingos, but lots of "Are you absolutely sure?" and "This procedure is permanent and irreversible." Was referred to him by Dr. Susan E. Webb for a tubal ligation at age 29. His office also provides a wide range of women's health care. Another member advises "I sat through more bingo than a nursing home aide only to be told that he didn't think I was "appreciative" of the finality at my age. After wasting 2 hours of my life he asked if I wanted an implant." and "Never heard of a POC being turned down even at 22, never seen a single childless white woman get approved even after 30"

(F, 36, Bilateral Salpingectomy) Absolutely fabulous and professional doctor who will take you at your word that you're ready. I was referred by someone else who said they received no questions, and I too was not bingoed or doubted in the slightest. Didn't need to bring a binder or anything, I just explained my whys and she got it 100%. She did the surgery and I was out in an hour, minimal gas, and two of the three incisions are hidden. Simply fantastic and quick experience from consult to outpatient!

[Dr. Walter Schoutko](https://www.utmedicalcenter.org/doctors/walter-w-schoutko-md-facog/) OBGYN UT Hospital Knoxville, TN USA bilateral salpingectomy. Female, 28yrs old, married, no kids. I was referred to him by my primary care, went in with my husband and he focused completely on me and never once looked at my husband. He only asked to make sure I knew the risks of the procedure and that it was permanent and couldn't be reversed. He assured me that he knew I was intelligent and obviously researched before coming to him and could make my own decisions. I felt safe and in good hands, with someone I could trust, and that I was being treated like a human for the first time. Surgery went well, he did a great job, barely have scars.

[Dr. Emily Edwards](http://www.summitdeanehill.com/physician/emily-edwards/) Knoxville, TN USA Primary Care, accepts BCBS insurance. Approves tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, and other permanent sterilization. Very accepting and understanding, to the point and straightforward. Within the first appointment was willing to refer me to a likely OBGYN who would approve sterilization. Responds quickly through online portal to questions and concerns, a great childfree friendly doctor. NB Dr Edward's office advised a 21yo member they don't do IUDs. 

[Dr Lora Greene](genobgyn.com) Call 8657694444 for appointments. Willing to sterilise under 25 (I'm f24) if insurance covers. I have BCBS through the state and they approved no problem. NB Dr Greene advised a 21yo she was too young for an IUD. 

Dr. Edward Kim at the University of Tennessee Medical Center completed my vasectomy when I was 26/M back in 2013. He didn't ask any pointless questions. No bingoes. He just made me aware of all the risks and the low chance of a successful reversal. For those few in the transgender community, like myself, he performed an orchiectomy on me at 32 years old. Once again, no stupid questions. He just wanted my two letters from mental health professionals for insurance purposes. The only downside to him is he has zero bedside manners. The most blunt and direct doctor I've ever dealt with. For better or worse.

Dr Paul Hatcher in the UT Medical Center for Urology. 1932 Alcoa highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920. Vasectomy, 24 years old. Fiancé, but not married. No kids.

Said my decision is a sensible thing to do. He’s very experienced and professional.

Dr. Laura Ellen Moffat, Fort Sanders OBGYN 501 19th St, Knoxville, TN 37916, The doc was amazing at the consult, said it's my body and my choice and she understands my concern after Roe v. Wade. Had original consult mid July and she had openings for surgery as soon as mid August. Completely amazing and can confirm she follows through bc the tubes are officially out :)

**Lebanon** 

[Dr. Kimberly Hunt](https://tristarmedgroup.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Kimberly-A-Hunt-MD). I'm 24F, unmarried, childfree. Can't afford surgery right now so I went in for an IUD, but discussed a bilateral salpingectomy anyway - Dr. Hunt said if I could afford it, she would have tied my tubes right away! She had absolutely no hesitation about my choice. "It's not something someone would suggest lightly, so I trust you." was a direct quote from her during the appointment! Takes most insurances, friendly staff with no bingos from anyone, normal wait times. This doctor is as yet unconfirmed as sterilisation friendly but may be open to the procedure. 

[Dr Michael Stockwell](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/stockwell-michael) at Vanderbilt Wilson County will complete tubals for patients that do not want children. He does not require you to previously have children or for your husband to consent to anything.

+1 [Dr. Stockwell](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/stockwell-michael) performed my bilateral salpingectomy without bingos. He did casually mention the possibility of regret on the surgical paperwork, but it was moreso for liability purposes. I am 27F, childfree, and single.

Doctor is a fertility specialist but also agreed to bisalp on very first visit. Only discussed bingos and regret in terms of "I have to cover all of this for legal reasons" and even joked with me about not wanting kids during pre-op. 

Dr Gregory Burana at Adams Patterson Gynecology. He removed my tubes. I am 23, no kids, married, and gave me no issues. He required two appointments but the second was also my pre op appointment so it wasn’t two appointments before I could schedule. I scheduled my first surgery after my first appointment and then went to my second the week before my surgery while also completing blood work.

Dr. Jason Mullenix. I had a tubal ligation w/ cauterization and a removed section since insurance didn't totally cover a salpingectomy. I have no kids. He offered to do this back when I was 23, I just couldn't afford it because I didn't have as great of coverage as I do now, at 31 (Cigna, btw). He was 100% supportive of the fact that I do not want children. I had my surgery today and am very comfortable at home, eleven hours later. He's fantastic and is wonderful about informed consent and explaining pros and cons to each surgery approach.

+1 Jason Mullinex in the Memphis, TN area. I am childfree & he performed my tubal ligation procedure. He was respectful of my choices, listened to me every step of the way, and made sure I understood all my options for sterilization & worked with me to get my pesky insurance to cover it 100%. His bedside manner is incredible. I cannot recommend him enough.

This gynecologist no longer has age limits provided the patient is of a legal age to consent for the procedure. 

+1 Dr Estepp, I was 24 and childfree. No argument, no “husband” permission, no “age limit”, no number of children limit. I loved her. She was very respectful and understanding of my wishes. Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. Almost zero pain afterwards, my incisions were the size of my pinky nails

Dr. Gregory J. Burana and Dr. M. Leigh Keegan at [Adams Patterson](https://www.adamspatterson.com/), 1727 KIRBY PARKWAY, SUITE 200 MEMPHIS, TN 38120. TEL: (901) 767-3810. I'm 24 going on 25 and unmarried. They said yes, no questions asked. They just made sure I knew it was permanent. Dr. Burana did so well, I barely even got scars.

**Murfreesboro**

[Dr. Wear](https://www.whstn.com),  at Women’s Health Specialist located in St. Thomas hospital. I am a 29 year old child free woman living Murfreesboro, TN and in January I had my tubes completely removed. Dr. Cynthia Wear is PHENOMENAL! I cannot recommend this incredible woman enough. She is truly a fantastic practitioner that is all about bodily autonomy. She is 100% non-judgmental and is dedicated to finding the best control method for you. She is willing to consult with ANYONE about child free procedures. When I told her I wanted a permanent form of birth control, Dr. Wear gave me ZERO pushback and immediately scheduled a consult to make sure I was able to have the surgery. I cried tears of relief in my car in the parking lot that day as a decade long dream was coming together.

[Dr Sovana Moore](https://www.whstn.com/provider/sovana-moore-md), A little over a year ago she performed a tubal ligation and removed both of my tubes fully at the age of 25. The nurse gave me a hard time and was trying to talk me out of it but I was in Dr Moore's office all of 17 min and she agreed without any arguments. I had the surgery 2 months later and definitely do not regret it. She is still my gyno and I have since refered 2 other people to her for different issues and she has resolved or helped both immediately. I can't recommend her for this list more she made it so easy and stress free for me when I was sure I would spend years fighting for my right to my own body.

**Nashville**

[Dr. Nathaniel Klein](https://nashvillegeneral.org/doctors/nathaniel-klein-md-mba-ms). 30, single, no previous pregnancies. I had an incredible experience with Dr. Klein! I got a bilateral salpingectomy 5 weeks after my first call. At my new patient consult, we discussed why I didn't want other birth control options and he did explain how this can be a procedure people regret, but it just seemed like he was doing his due diligence in informing me. I didn't feel like I had to prove myself, wasn't asked about marital status, and he agreed to do the procedure. I felt like I was in great hands through every step of it, and my surgery went perfectly! He also specializes in pelvic pain, so if you potentially have endometriosis, you will be in extra good hands with him. Also note: I was anxious about seeing a male OBGYN because I have trauma background/panic attacks during anything OBGYN-related, but he was so great that I will continue to see him in the future! I did not need to do a pelvic exam during consult/post-op.

[Dr. Roseann Maikis](http://www.womenshealthnashville.com). 330 23rd Ave North, Suite 604, Nashville, Tennessee, USA 37203. (615) 986-6039. 30, Divorced, No children or prior pregnancies. The very first time I saw Dr. Maikis I asked her for a permanent sterilization and she immediately agreed with no hesitation. She didn’t ask me about my relationship status, didn’t ask if I was sure or “but what if you cHanGe YoUr MiNd”. She only discussed the standard surgical risks (and benefits!) and scheduled my surgery before I left the exam room.

+1 Dr Maikis,  I am a 29 year old who has been trying to get sterilized for about 10 years. I do not want children and I have a family history of ovarian cancer. She was the first provider to take me seriously and quickly helped me to get the procedure done. It was a very smooth experience for it being my first surgery.

[Dr. Joseph Pazona](https://www.pazonamd.com/) 2201 Murphy Ave Suite 403, Nashville, Tennessee 37203 (615) 527-4700. vasectomy. 27, married, no kids. Overall fantastic experience, was made really comfortable by Dr. Pazona and his team. Only relevant medical questions asked, and he did not ask about marital status or child status. He was honest and upfront about what to expect in the near and long term, what all of my options would be following the procedure, proper aftercare, etc. I was perhaps overly-honest and volunteered the info that I don't want any kids, which didn't change things at all. I'd recommend to anyone.

+1 Dr Pazona, I was 28 when I got it done. He kept the questions simple, Do I have kids Am I sure with my decision His procedure is also irreversible”

Dr. Amanda Manceau-Kha at Advanced Women's Health in Nashville. She was 100% willing to sterilize me at the age of 23. She didn't bingo me and instead replied with 'It's your body and you choose what you want to do with it.' She took the time to go through each procedure and answer all of my questions and was willing to do either a bisalp or a tubal ligation (it will depend on my insurance). 

Dr. Tara Nielsen/Dr. William Kellett at Vanderbilt (Dr. Nielsen was a resident at time of procedure, Dr. Kellett attending) tubal ligation on patient aged 27. Very thorough about informing me of all possible options and making sure I was sure, which I appreciated. Very professional and friendly staff on day of procedure. *Update 28 March 2022 Dr Nielson is currently only attending to patients with infertility at Nashville, general gynecology patients will need to travel to the Franklin TN location*

SaCara D. Shaw, M.D. recommended and agreed to perform salpingectomy when 24y/o patient expressed wanting to be sterilized.

Michelle Roach, M.D. at Vanderbilt- willing to perform bilateral salpingectomy on 22 y.o female after 6 month waiting period from initial consultation. Non-judgemental and very professional. NB tried to push another member towards an implant instead. *Update 28 March 2022 Dr Roach is currently only seeing adolescents**

Dr. Ivana Sturdivant Thompson in Nashville Tn at Vanderbilt. Procedure: bilateral salpingectomy. Single 24 yo Female. Notes: was very kind and relaxing. Walked through every possibility of the procedure. I’m also not in a committed relationship and she still agreed.

[Dr Melissa Reynolds](https://www.womenshealthnashville.com/our-physicians/). Bilateral salpingectomy. 38, partnered with a man, never married, and childfree. Had initial appointment for well woman exam, asked for a bisalp. A week later, got a call to schedule surgery (5 weeks after first appt). Also had to have an official consult a week before surgery. She wanted to make sure I was sure since I was a new patient. There was no pressure to use a less permanant form of birth control and she didn't ask how my partner felt. Cigna through healthcare.gov $5000 is the initial quote, paid $1300 upfront, hoping to get all costs covered

-1 Dr Reynolds, I asked her when I was 25 and was denied bc ‘my husband may want kids’ or ‘if this marriage doesn’t work my next husband may want kids’. She may have changed her stance as I am now 38, however I asked her about having a bislap last year at my annual and her response was ‘the IUD works well for you so you just need to stick with it.’ I am going to press her again at my annual this year and if she still refuses I will confirm and find another doctor. I have been seeing dr Reynolds since I was 17 and will be 39 this year. She is well aware of my strong desire to never have a child and has pushed back every time I have asked to be sterilized.

[Dr Christopher Hill](https://www.urologynashville.com/providers/christopher-c-hill-md/). Performed a vasectomy on a married 30yr old with no children My husband did not report any bingos, said the doctor was incredibly nice and had a good sense of humor (also said he reported to have done over 10,000 vasectomies including the one on himself) I don’t believe the cost exceeded $1,000

[Laura Binkley](https://www.womenshealthnashville.com/our-physicians/) Procedure: Hysterectomy Age 31, unmarried (with partner), childfree. She agreed to do the procedure no questions asked, and it was completed within 2 months of our original consultation.

[Dr. Amy Weeks](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/weeks-amy). Dr. Weeks, with the Vanderbilt Women's Center, completed the initial consultation for a bilateral salpingectomy but recommended me to Dr. Harvey for the actual surgery since she specializes in plus size patients. She still approved the procedure and I would recommend her to smaller sized patients.

[Dr. Lara Harvey](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/harvey-lara?_ga=2.170721123.25528333.1656213341-1769665567.1656213341). Dr Harvey, with the Vanderbilt Women's Center, completed a bilateral salpingectomy on September 16th 2021 I was 27, nonbinary, single, 0 children, 100% childfree. Neither Doctor questioned my motives they both asked mandated questions but clarified that they had to and did not attempt to bingo me or push. Both were respectful of my pronouns and were very professional.

[Dr. Lindsey Zamora](https://search.vanderbilthealth.com/doctors/zamora-lindsey). Bi-Salp About me: 25yrs old, married, husband has vasectomy, i kept IUD, dr knew about my beliefs for 5 years, no questions were asked. We even joked that i would be having a party after the procedure. Childfree for life. Her wait times to get an appointment can be around 1 month, then another month or 2 for the surgery. IMO she's worth the wait, especially being in the south.

Dr Erin Rebele in Nashville, TN performed my sterilization surgery(I am early 30s, married and no kids.) She was so kind, respectful, and comforting throughout the whole process- from the inquiry about surgery to the surgery itself. A doctor like her is hard to find in TN. Highly recommend!

Dr. Samhita Lakshmi Nelamangala at Vanderbilt Center for Women’s Health Vanderbilt Health One Hundred Oaks 719 Thompson Lane Suite 27100 Nashville, Tennessee 37204 (615)343-5700. Dr. N, as she told me to address her, was super friendly and completely supportive of women’s rights. She wore a pro-choice pin, a trans-friendly pin, a pride pin, and a bodily autonomy pin. I saw her for a follow-up to an ultrasound I had after a miscarriage, and I asked her about sterilization. We discussed my health and the reasons I wanted to be sterilized, never bingo’d me. She specifically stated several times that she respects a woman’s right to choose. Dr. N told me that a bi-salp sounds like the right choice for me and scheduled me a consult with the surgical team two weeks later on August 2, 2022. I’m 35F, childfree, unmarried, but I did recently have an unwanted pregnancy, and a very lucky, wanted miscarriage. NB we have added this doctor as someone highly likely to be childfree friendly but not fully verified. 

Dr. Jessica Rizzuto and Dr. Barry Grimm at Vanderbilt Center for Women’s Health Vanderbilt Health One Hundred Oaks 719 Thompson Lane Suite 27100 Nashville, Tennessee 37204 (615)343-5700. I’m 35F, childfree, and unmarried. I saw Dr. Rizzuto and Dr. Grimm for a bi-salp surgical consult. We went over my health, all the contraceptives I’ve used over the years, and if I wanted kids. Dr. Rizzuto didn’t ask any bingo questions, but I overheard Dr. Grimm ask if my husband wanted kids, outside exam room the door. Dr. Rizzuto deflected and told him I was determined. Once in the room Dr. Grimm did not bingo me at all, but stated several times that afterwards I would not be able to have kids. “That’s the point.” I asked for an ablation as well, to help my horrific periods. After going over the effectiveness of an ablation and wanting to be sterilized. Both doctors suggested a hysterectomy, removal of tubes, uterus, and cervix; and keeping my ovaries. Which is what I always wanted, but never thought I’d be approved.

Dr. Michael Fields. Fields Center for Women’s health, Turkey Creek, Tennessee. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 19 year old single female. He was very straightforward, and did not bingo me or interrogate me. [Fields Center for Women’s Health](https://fieldsgynroboticsurgery.com)
