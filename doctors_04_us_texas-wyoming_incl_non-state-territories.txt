[James G. Bass](http://www.abileneobgyn.com/abilene-obgyn/obgyn-providers.aspx#bass?utm_source=local-listing&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=website-link) performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 29 year old woman, "Only needed an initial appointment before setting surgery appointment. Went through courtesies of regular questions, but did not try to change mind on getting surgery. He does offer ablations as well."

[Dr. Kristen B Mitchell, MD](https://www.hendrickhealth.org/find-a-provider/kristen-b-mitchell-md/) 1665 Antilley Road, Suite 260, Abilene, TX 79606, 325-794-5348. Feb 2023. Bisalp on 21-year-old single redditor. I called to schedule a consult in December, and had the consult on 1/16/23. I was immediately put on the schedule for 2/3/23 to have my tubes removed completely. Dr. Mitchell talked with me about my desire for a tubal and made sure to say ‘just because I legally have to tell you’ before listing non-permanent birth controls. My consultation was completely covered by insurance, although we did make it my yearly exam as well; and I have not yet received any bill for today’s procedure.

**Arlington**

[Dr. Omar Sarmini, M.D](https://medicalcityarlington.com/physicians/profile/Omar-R-Sarmini-MD) My personal Ob/gyn who also does surgery. He's also my mom's, grandma's, and aunts, as well as the doctor who delivered me. Under the restrictions of his hospital he cant do sterilization under age 21 but he only asks the required questions and won't try to sway you. NB Dr Sarmini may have since retired. 

[Russell Dickey, M.D.](https://www.usmd.com/locations-nav/providers/tx/russell-dickey-md/1114960333.html) out of USMD in Arlington, Texas (811 Interstate 20 W Suite 218, Arlington, Texas 76017). Procedure: laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy as well as IUD removal. Fully covered by insurance in accordance with ACA rules. Details: 30 years old, married, no children. Been going to the same OB practice for 17 years, been on hormonal birth control for 17 years. 11 years asking my nurse practitioner for sterilization, she finally set up a consult with Dr Dickey. He approved me at the consult without bingoing me. Surgery was scheduled for three weeks later.

Brad Boccaccio, DO, MS 3201 Matlock Rd Ste 350 Arlington TX 76015-2954 817-468-3255. This doctor was super awesome, approved my surgery right away and didn't need any permission from my partner. This doc is a typical obgyn that also specializes in the surgery side as well.

**Athens** 

[Dr. Mark Eldore](monarchwomenshealth.com), Age: 30 as of June 7th, divorced, no children. Great experience, only asked me if I was sure and what I would do if a future partner wanted kids. I said I wouldn’t be with them and he said okay let’s get you scheduled. I do have health issues so that may have been a factor as well. I’ve been to a lot of doctors in the past and he was kind and understanding. Practice also accepts texas womens health which is like a Medicaid for womens health issues in texas.

+1 Dr Eldore, 26F He asked me my reasons for wanting sterilization as any doctor would. He asked me about my personal life, didn't make a fuss that we have ZERO kids or that my hubby had a vasectomy, and asked if I was sure. He didn't BINGO, and even respected my wishes for a BISALP over tying the tubes instead. I've never met a more respectful male GYNO than he, and the process with the hospital was flawlessly easy. My insurance covered the surgeon fee at 100%, I paid $350 towards upfront costs, and I'll be responsible for around $400/500 in Anesthesiologist services because I haven't met my out-of-pocket expenses. I checked in at 0600, and surgery started at 0725 and lasted approximately 30 minutes. Please see this medical provider. You will have found a gem!

**Austin** 

[Dr. Prisacaru](https://www.sevenhillswomen.com/dr-prisacarus-cv.htm) Dr. Prisacaru is located in north Austin, Tx. In June 2022 I had a bilateral salpingectomy with an endometrial ablation. I am a single 26 year old cishet woman with no children, Childfree mindset since adolescence. I first made an appointment at the beginning of June. I explained my desires not to have kids are pregnancy. She gave me the option of iud, my procedure, or hysterectomy, and what insurance would pay for. She did not question my decision. After blood work and an ultrasound I was scheduled for surgery within the month.

+1 [Dr. Genoveva Prisacaru](https://www.sevenhillswomen.com/dr-prisacarus-cv.html). Laparoscopic tubal ligation via bilateral salpingectomy. 23 year old female, not married but in a committed relationship, no children and no possibility of future children. Dr. Prisacaru is an amazing doctor. I asked her about permanent birth control options the very first time I visited her for a yearly check up. Absolutely no bingos from her, the only requirements she had was you must be 21 and absolutely sure you don’t want kids. Amazing bedside manner and bubbly personality. Would highly recommend if she’s within your network. I did pay a few grand out of pocket since bcbs did not cover it 100%.

[Dr. Christina Salazar at UTHealth Austin](https://uthealthaustin.org/directory/christina-salazar) She completed a bilateral salpingectomy on me yesterday. I’m 25, unmarried, no kids, but am in a serious monogamous relationship. I have only good things to say about this clinic in general. Dr. Salazar definitely took the time to make sure I really wanted this and encouraged me to keep trying other options but even from the first time we spoke she let me know that she would do it if I wanted it. Getting an initial appointment was easy but I was already a patient at the clinic. My surgery was scheduled around 2 months out so expect some wait before you actually get it done. It was 100% covered by BCBS TX HealthSelect (State of Texas employee insurance plan)

[Dr. Lauren Thaxton, OB/GYN Austin, Texas UT Health Austin, Women's Health Institute](https://uthealthaustin.org/directory/lauren-thaxton). Bilateral Salpingectomy on a 23 year old who is single with no kids. Dr. Thaxton teaches at the university so there is a wait time for an initial consult, mine was scheduled a month out. She approved me for surgery at my initial consult with zero bingos. Specifically, she said, "My job as a doctor is to give you the facts about a procedure. It is not my job to tell you what is best for your body." The billing code she uses for surgery confused my insurance, so I had to pay out of pocket on surgery day and then appeal for a refund later.

[Leah Tatum MD](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/clinics/arc-north-austin-ob-gyn?fbclid=IwAR2JdvY5znjqT9k1DllVLVxSXAjZPiBHz59lvfYMQp5yYenJuPQhIqDYgNY). This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am an obgyn in Austin, Texas and I’ve performed many sterilizations and hysterectomies on patients without children and those who desire a childfree life. It has been evident to me that a shift in medicine has been needed from the paternalistic way of practicing in the past regarding sterilization. I feel even more strongly that in our current climate we have a need to help patients gain access to the contraception (permanent if preferred) they desire to avoid being in a situation where someone could be forced to carry a pregnancy they don’t want. We are located in North Austin and have a clinic that strives to provide a safe space for all patients regardless of gender identity or reproductive plans. We also strive to provide trauma-informed care."

+1 Dr, Tatum. May 2023. Bisalp on 21-year-old redditor. LBGTQ+ friendly doctor. She was so respectful, easy going, and kind. Very easy to talk to. She explained everything about the procedure, including informing me that they’d be putting a catheter in while I was under. She asked me my pronouns multiple times over the course of our several appointments (I go by any, even she/her, but it definitely confuses people). Would highly recommend her.

[Dr. Romy Ghosh](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/romy-ghosh). Bilateral Salpingectomy. I was 30, single and childfree and she agreed with no pushback after our first meeting. My scars are exceptionally minimal. 

[Allison Urrutia, M.D. - Gynics Associates](http://gynics.com) - tubal ligation + ablation on 27 yo. 

+1 Dr Urrutia - She was incredibly polite and friendly. When I told her I was surprised at the lack of pushback from her, Dr. Urrutia stated that it’s my body and I have every right to decide what I want to do with it. The only drawback I can think of is that she’s booked out quite often and my initial appointment to see her had to be scheduled a month in advance.

[Dr. Margaret Whitney, OB/GYN Texas UT Health Austin](https://uthealthaustin.org/directory/margaret-whitney). Dr. Whitney was the first doctor I spoke to at UT Health Austin and she agreed to perform my bilateral salpinectomy. Due to Covid-19 delays and her own maternity leave, the scheduling didn't end up working out, but she transferred me over to Dr. Thaxton who did a great job.

[Dr. Lauren Thaxton, OB/GYN Austin, Texas UT Health Austin, Women's Health Institute](https://uthealthaustin.org/directory/lauren-thaxton) Bilateral Salpingectomy on a 28 year old, Bilateral Salpingectomy on a 25 year old. Dr Thaxton did a great job and I had a GREAT recovery!

[Tara Cherry, M.D. - Austin Regional Clinic](http://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/tara-cherry) (Essure, Tubal, laparoscopic tubal ligation on 21y/o.) Dr. Cherry was very kind and didn't bingo. She asked several times if I was 100% sure, but quickly accepted my answer (felt like she was required to). My procedure was really quick and easy. She claimed she had done the procedure often, had it done to herself after having 2 kids, and said she had performed it for CF 18 y/os after "longer conversations."

[Renu Chalasani, M.D. - Austin Regional Clinic](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/renu-chalasani) (Tubal on 26 yo)

+1 [Dr Chalasani](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/renu-chalasani?utm_source=online-directory&utm_campaign=yext&utm_content=renu-chalasani). She gave me no pushback at all, except to ask if I was sure. I saw her initially for a pap exam and to discuss the surgery , since I've not had a pap in a few years, and she agreed immediately. Set up a date for a pre op appointment, and then surgery appointment when the calendar for the month was available. The procedure went well. She's also the one who does the actual procedure. She's extremely polite, awesome doctor. Insurance covered most, I had to pay about $430 something at the pre op appointment. Which is a lot better than a few thousand if you ask me! Hope you guys can add her in! Thanks for your time, and everything you do to provide helpful info for us who are childfree. I found her by using your list to find a Dr in Austin, but the one I wanted to see wasn't available at the time I made my appointment, and i found Dr Chalasani instead! So it was almost by accident I found her. But she's amazing! Thanks again so much for this sub

Austin, TX 78758, 512-681-5040. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy on 32-year-old with severe adenomyosis. Dr. Devin Garza answered all my questions and explained everything very thoroughly. He didn't even double check about my wanting kids! Oct 2022.

[Parviz Kavoussi, M.D. - Austin Fertility and Reproductive Medicine](http://www.austinfertility.com/male-patients/no-scalpel-vasectomy/)  (Vasectomy.  Claimed to only perform vasectomy on men 25 and older.)

[Dr. Sandeep Mistry](http://www.northaustinurology.com/vasectomy) (Vasectomy. Consultation and procedure in the same visit).

[Dr Koushik Shaw](http://austinurologyinstitute.com/) -  I'm 38 and child free. Called to schedule 3 weeks ago, gave them my insurance info over the phone, and they scheduled the consultation and procedure in the same visit (today). I specifically asked him about CF requirements after the procedure - his response was "As long as they are of legal age, its not my duty to tell anybody whether or not they can have a vasectomy. If they can fight and die in the military, I'm not going to judge them if they don't want children".

+1 Dr. Shaw in Austin. For reference, I am 18 years old and childless. I called, and was in the waiting room 3 days after. Very quick consultation. As long as you seem sure about your decision and have read up on it, he has no problem with performing the operation. Highly recommended.

[Dr. Caroline "Carrie" Kaufman](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/caroline-carrie-kaufman) (Tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy).  Body-positive doctor, LGBTQ+ friendly. When I told her I didn't want kids, she said "It doesn't matter to me whether or not you want kids, tell me what you want me to do."  She was the one who suggested bilateral salpingectomy!  Definitely in your corner and here for you, without any judgement.

+1 Dr. Kaufman. Nov 2022 bisalp on 20-year-old redditor. She approved me right away without hesitation. Did not even ask for my age. I didn't even need to show her my sterilization binder. I mentioned I had made it though and she asked me if Reddit told me to do that. 

+1 Dr. Kaufman. Sept 2022 bisalp on woman in obese BMI range.  I never felt like she made my weight an issue.

+1 Dr Kaufman. I (21F, single) had a laparoscopic bisalp in December of 2022. I was approved without any pushback in May of 2022 (I was 20 at the time) and only had to wait until December due to personal travel plans. In our consult she said "yes there's a risk of regret but we have an ethical responsibility to provide this service to patients". 10/10 would recommend!

+1 Dr. Kaufman. March 2023. Bisalp on 21-year-old redditor. Dr. Caroline Kaufman and her team did a wonderful job performing the surgery and making me feel comfortable and safe.

[Dr. Stephen Hardeman] (https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/stephen-hardeman-md/) (Vasectomy)

[Dr. Christopher Yang](https://northaustinurology.com/dr-chris-yang/) (Vasectomy)

[Dr. Wendy Cutler] (https://adclinic.com/physicians/profile/Wendy-Cutler-MD) (Bilateral salpingectomy). At first she asked a lot of questions regarding my reasonings for wanting sterilization. Her questions were valid and genuine, without judgment and only out of curiousity since I personally worked in Labor and Delivery (alongside her at times!) Once I talked to her about my reasonings and the fact that I had researched a lot about the procedures, she was extremely respectful of my opinion and said "We can get this done in March if you want!" It was February 2020 at that time. She gave me many opportunities to "change my mind" but only in regards to the type of sterilization procedure (bisalp vs tubal ligation), since they have different permenancy rates. Again, these opportunities never felt like they were given out of doubt or judgement. She is wonderfully sweet and very skillful! The procedure was flawless and with minimal pain.

[Dr. Michael Phillips](https://www.aaobgyn.com/provider-bio/michael-f-phillips-md) with Austin Area OBGYN. I'm 31 and he performed a bisalp on me a couple of months ago. 

Dr. Tyler Hancock performed a Bilateral salpingectomy on me (29 years old, divorced) with no push back. He just gave me a run down of the procedure, stressing that it was irreversible, and had me sign a consent form. He was very nice and professional and I would recommend him to anyone.

+1 Dr Hancock, he told me “I as your doctor trust you to make decisions for yourself and your body” and that over the summer he performed this procedure on a lesbian couple:) I believe everyone at this practice is amazing and I couldn’t recommend them more :)

[Tyler McClintock, MD](https://www.austinmidtownurology.com/provider/tyler-mcclintock-md). Scalpel Free Vasectomy. Age: 32 Marital status: Married Childfree status: No children. Andrew Barger did the pre-op consult, Tyler McClintock did the procedure. Hard to reach clinic via phone, portal is decent. Entire staff was friendly and caring. Procedure was straightforward and Dr McClintock talked to me about how he and his wife are childfree. No bingos, no prying questions, just multiple confirmations of the procedure steps, and care needs.

[Dr. Courtney Wiener](http://www.gynics.com/?page_id=1519) - 26 Single 0 kids, never want to experience pregnancy. Had a great experience with Dr. Wiener. She's a great gyno and performed my Bilateral Salpingectomy herself. When discussing, she told me once about the high rates of people under thirty experiencing regret, along with surgical risks, but immediately believed me when I told her I wanted the procedure with no questions. The Gynics Associates office went above and beyond to help me figure out insurance coverage and options. I was able to get the procedure scheduled within two weeks of talking to Dr. Wiener. The procedure experience itself was comfortable and went seamlessly.

+1 Dr Courtney Wiener, 18F, single, not sexually active, had a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. Met with her for the very first time, told her I wanted a bisalp and she had no arguments— said it was my body, my choice. Didn’t even need a pelvic exam. Two months later I had the surgery. BCBSTX PPO covered the procedure— no money was due on the day of.

Dr Jennifer Mushtaler MD Kindbody OB/GYN and Fertility Clinic 100 Colorado St. Austin TX 78701, I’m a 27 year old unmarried woman, I had an appointment today with a doctor who was beyond understanding and empowering about my wanting to get sterilized. She asked the right questions, listened intently, and talked to me like an equal. I’d love to have her and her clinic added to the list. She knows that with the new state of the world she will be seeing a lot of new faces soon (for birth control as well). Truly night and day from other providers I’ve seen.

+1 Dr Mushtaler, 27 year old unmarried woman, I had an appointment today with a doctor who was beyond understanding and empowering about my wanting to get sterilized. She asked the right questions, listened intently, and talked to me like an equal.

[Dr. Fiona Esfandiari](https://www.aaobgyn.com/provider-bio/fiona-esfandiari-md). She performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me (28 YO, not married, no kids). She did not question my decision, give me any pushback, and no bingos. She was really supportive of my choice and the process to get scheduled was straightforward.

[Dr. Maura Ronquillo](https://healthcare.ascension.org/doctors/1912433707/maura-r-ronquillo-austin-tx), M.D. 2 affiliations: Ascension Seton and UT Health Austin, TX. Bilateral salpingectomy, 28 y.o., childfree, long term relationship, but not married. She asked all the required questions and maybe 1 borderline bingo, but in general, it was a fairly simple visit. I had to wait 30 days between the consult and the surgery, but there was no waitlist so scheduling was easy. She does a video visit 1 week before to check that you're still 100% sure. I had a good experience overall.

[Eric Giesler, MD](https://urologyaustin.com/doctors/eric-giesler-md/). Vasectomy. 41, Married, Child free. Asked absolutely zero questions about wanting kids. He specifically started working two additional days a week recently to make sure everyone is covered. Two week turn around from phone call to procedure. Wonderful bedside manner.

[Dr. Andrea Campaigne](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/clinics/arc-north-austin-ob-gyn) performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 29F, divorced, no children. No bingos and she was nothing but supportive through the whole process. I did mention to her that I had been considering sterilization for years, but I don’t think that was a factor in her approving the surgery for me. She believes it’s up to a woman to make her own decisions and was genuinely happy to help me with mine. At my post op she showed me before and after photos, which was really cool to see. She was my first try at finding someone who would do the surgery and I’m so happy with my whole experience that I will continue seeing her for my regular gynecologist visits.

[Dr. Amy M. Chapman, MD](https://www.whdatx.com/provider/amy-chapman-md), [Women's Health Domain](https://www.whdatx.com/), Austin, TX, USA. Bilateral Salpingectomy, St. David's Surgery Center - an ambulatory all ob-gyn only facility Facility Website: https://stdavidsaustinsurgerycenter.com/. 36, CF. She was approachable, direct, and confident in the procedure and techniques (laparoscopic) she uses for salpingectomy. Everyone at Women's Health Domain and St. David's Surgery Center were great - supportive, non-judgmental, informative/knowledgeable, and compassionate. Loved being at a ob-gyn only surgical center vs. hospital. Highly recommend! She told me that she fully supports reproductive rights and had earlier that same day, sterilized a 21 or 22 year old (I can't recall if she said 21 or 22) woman who had never had a child. 

[Dr Amanda Halle, MD, OB-GYN](https://www.aaobgyn.com/provider-bio/amanda-halle-md) Address: 12200 Renfert Way Suite 100 Austin, Texas 78758 Appointment Phone Number: 512-652-7001 Procedure Completed: Bilateral Salpingectomy in 2023. 29 year old female, healthy (no medical reason for sterilization), no children, not married/never married. Made an appointment with Dr. Amanda Halle for my annual exam in August 2022 & when the doctor brought up birth control, I mentioned I was thinking of getting a tubal ligation, if she was open to that. She only asked me one question: “Are you sure you don’t want to have biological children?” I answered her honestly & she said to just call the office whenever I am ready to schedule & we can get it done, but she typically does complete removal of fallopian tubes & that is what she would recommend. About 3 months later, I reached out again to see about scheduling the bilateral salpingectomy (as recommended) for the new year and, it took a few weeks, but by early December, I had my surgery scheduled for January. Didn’t have to schedule an additional appointment or anything (besides regular pre-op & post-op appointments) and didn’t run into any trouble with any other staff, either. No one in the practice or at the surgery center questioned me & all respected my choice, even on the day of surgery. Overall, great experience! My only complaint is receiving conflicting post-op instructions/restrictions as I am returning to work. Other than that, doctor & staff have been SO great & helpful.

[Dr. Leah Mello, MD](https://www.austinregionalclinic.com/doctors/leah-mello) ARC Seton Northwest, 11111 Research Blvd Suite 475, Austin, TX 78759, 512-338-8181. March 2022. Tubal ligation on 21-year-old redditor. Dr Mello was amazing. She explained the process and explained the risks. She did not discourage me but made sure I understood what having a Tubal Ligation would mean. I fully recommend her.

[Dr Clarissa Gutierrez from Austin, TX)(https://austinobgyn.womenshealthtx.com/provider/clarissa-gutierrez-md/). She gave me a bisalp at the age of 21, unmarried, no kids. She did have me wait 4 months after asking before scheduling the consultation just to be sure I was certain and listed the sCaRy sTaTiStiCs of how many women under the age of 30 regret getting sterilized. During my actual consultation she was straight up just like "you know this is permanent, irreversible, and you have a chance of regretting it?" I said yes and she was like alright cool let's do it! I was scheduled for less than 2 weeks out and did have some insurance issues. They (the surgery center) didn't notify me of the full cost of the procedure until the day before surgery, although they do offer payment plans. With insurance, the total cost was about $3,160 and I only had to pay $1,600 before I met my deductible and insurance covered the rest. The staff were super chill and not a single person had any issue with what I was having done, no questions or bingos in sight.

She only asked if I was certain. I felt calm and seen. Actual procedure took 15 min plus the time for me to come out of the anesthesia.Walking the same day and feeling fully healed by the next day. Healed beautifully with only 2 scars. The hospital staff at Valley Baptist was not supportive.

+1 Vasectomy on 42M CF. Clear and understandable, helpful staff. Answers questions patiently. He is in the referral network for the VA outpatient care program. There were a couple of urologists I could have chosen, but the VA nurse told me that I really wanted this guy over the others. 

[Dr. Janelle M. Perrone, M.D.](http://www.bvwc.com/doctors/janelle-m-perrone-md/) 26F. No bingoes from the ENTIRE staff. I came in prepared with knowledge about the procedure (laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy) I wanted and that seemed to help my case. All I was ever asked was if I knew the procedure was 100% permanent. She is super professional and made sure to answer any of my questions. She made sure I was at ease on the day of my surgery, which was quite helpful. I would recommend her to anyone!

-1 Dr Perrone, unfortunately, she is now located with Chi St. Joseph who will not approve of her doing the procedure at all. Chi St. Joseph is a Catholic system.

[Thomas William Davis MD](https://www.bswhealth.com/Thomas-Davis). Laparoscopic tubal ligation with rings (bands). About me: 25 years, Never married, Never pregnant. I was surprised with how quick it all went. I was approved for the surgery upon my first visit and my insurance covered most of the procedure. I was responsible for around $2.5K USD. The only thing I got that was close to a bingo was when my intake nurse was curious as to why I never wanted a pregnancy, and even then, she was polite and seemingly non-judgmental. Dr. Davis, my surgeon, was incredibly hands-off when it came to my choice in the matter, just wanted to be sure it was a choice I made willingly.

+1 Dr. Davis. Oct 2022. Bisalp and hysterectomy on  CF 28F (married). I went to him as a new patient in August 2022 and was officially booked for the surgery in September. He was patient and fully listened to me; never argued or bingoed. He only asked if I was sure I didn’t want children. The insurance covered the majority of the cost, but I was required to pay the remaining balance of about $2,500 in full, pre-surgery (we used a credit card). He, his staff, and the nurses were wonderful and I’m very thankful for the level of care they provided me.

[Dr. Jeremy Vaughan](http://www.cedarhillobgyn.com/). 210 S Broad St, Cedar Hill, TX 75104. Tubal removal via Bilateral Salpingectomy. I asked Dr. Vaughan about sterilization when I was 17, and he told me to come back when I was 21 (when my Nexplanon expired and the age at which my current insurance would cover it). When I came back, I fully explained my reasoning to the nurse practitioner and she was on board and scheduled me for a checkup. I had a switch of insurance and used Aetna HMO, which they accepted at the time. Aetna is ACA compliant and covers bilateral salpingectomies accordingly. After a brief meeting with Dr. Vaughan I had a surgery date scheduled. Tldr: I had the procedure done at 21 years old, child-free and unmarried, and the process was painless and easy.

[Dr. Romulo Corrada, MD]( https://ccmedicalcenter.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Romulo-Corrada-MD) Coastal Bend Womens Center, 7121 South Padre Island Dr, Ste 200
Corpus Christi, TX 78412, (361) 993-6000. Bisalp on 23-year-old redditor. He was so sweet, treated me almost like family, and took me seriously. He didn't push back other than 3 or so questions to confirm it was what I really wanted and to make it clear that if I changed my mind about bio kids afterwards, I would have to have IVF. He never made me feel like I would regret it or like I was too young to know. Nov 2022.

[Dr Denise Lochner with the Coastal Bend Women's Center](https://obgyncorpuschristi.com/) - I had a bilateral salpingectomy done at age 33. Just had a consult scheduled where she was very enthusiastic about women making their own choices and then I was put on the surgical list.

+1 Dr. Lochner. Bisalp on 31-year-old redditor. One visit with her and it was an immediate yes. Oct 2022.

+1 Dr. Lochner. 29F. I was approved for bisalp and ablation with no bingos. I'm married, but she didn't ask about that or about my reasons. She said I could tell her if I want to, but she doesn't need me to prove anything. She just reiterated that it is permanent and irreversible.

**Dallas**

[Dr. Rachel Gunderson](https://carlosparnellmd.com/rachel-gunderson-md/) completed a tubal ligation on me. I’m a 24 y/o female, married, no kids, and have known I’m CF since I was a child. Procedure was performed about 8 weeks after my first appointment with her. No bingos and didn’t ask for spouse’s permission. Did due diligence in discussing alternative BC (pill, implant, IUD, depo shot). When I told her I wasn’t interested in those, due to extremely adverse reactions in the past, she had no qualms and put me on her surgical schedule. Says if you’re old enough to vote, drink, and join the military, you’re old enough to make reproductive health choices. Extremely respectful and professional, highly recommend her!

Dr. Jennifer Brooks is fantastic. I have no kids and was 21 when I got my tubes removed, and she was nothing but kind and supportive of my choice the entire process.

Melissa Crocket, with the obstetrics and gynecology department with UT Southwestern hospital. (214-645-8300). Tubal ligation, OP is under 30 and childfree. No pushback. 

[Dr. Ravi Mootha](http://www.drmootha.com/) (Vasectomy)

[Dr. Blake Frieden](http://www.drfriedenobgyn.com) (Tubal Ligation, Essure) I work as a counselor at an abortion clinic, and we refer all our patients seeking permanent sterilization to Dr. Frieden because he trusts people's choices.

Update: Dr Frieden's receptionist gave a 21 year old member a "hard no".

[Dr. Richard Salter - Advanced OB-GYN Associates](http://www.advancedobgynassociates.com/index.htm) (Essure) - performed Essure procedure on 23-year-old after one required consultation to go over the procedures, the risks, and medical history. No bingoes, but did walk through less-permanent options to cover bases. Extremely knowledgeable, most doctors in the area have worked with him as well)

+1 Dr Salter,  he performed a bilateral salpingectomy for me, I'm 33 with a long term boyfriend, no children. I checked the CF Doctor list and compared to the list of doctors my insurance covered, Dr. Salter was the result. No bingos from him or the staff, got me scheduled for the procedure within two months and would have done it sooner if I had been available. 

+1 Dr Salter (Advanced OB/GYN associates) in Dallas, TX. He and his staff were professional. 38F, no kids- he did not ask any questions as far as why I am asking for sterilization. I was not bingoed once. Surgery went smoothly. Highly recommend.

[Dr. Shannon McCants - Women's Health Alliance](http://www.womenshealthalliance.com/) (Tubal Ligation- various methods, Bilateral Salpingectomy). I found Dr. McCants on this list, and I'm seconding the suggestion. She performed my surgery and I had a great experience. The only question she asked was if I was 100% certain and aware it's permanent. After that she explained my options. No judgment or questioning from her or any of the nurses I interacted with. Highly recommend her! +1 bisalp 24yo, bisalp 29yo, hysterectomy age unknown, tubal ligation 29yo, bisalp 21yo, hysterectomy 32yo, bisalp 24yo. 

[Dr. Joy Peveto- Women's Health Alliance](http://www.womenshealthalliance.com/) (Bilateral salpingectomy). Very matter of fact, makes sure you understand the permanent nature of sterilization but no bingos other than doing her due diligence as a medical professional.  Highly recommend.  Was willing to sterilize 26F no children after initial consult. 

+1 Dr Peveto - As a 29F, I had a similar professional experience as the first patient. I found Dr. Peveto through this page, and I highly recommend her as well.

[Dr. Quynh Chi Dinh- Dallas Obstetrics &amp;amp;amp; Gynecology PA](http://www.dallasobgynpa.com/physicians-staff/quynh-chi-dinh-md) (Tubal Ligation, Essure)Due diligence but no bingo. Won't perform tubal ligation under 30 unless you have extenuating circumstances. Since I (28F) can't tolerate other forms of birth control, she agreed to do mine. 

Dr. Kerry Neal - Comprehensive Women's Healthcare  https://www.grapevineob.com/kerry-neal/ (essure, tubal ligation). Extremely professional and a great sense of humor. Very nice and respectful of my decision. Best doctor I've ever been to. Zero bingos (he wants to make sure you are making the right decision though).

-1 Dr Neal. As a first-time patient doing an annual visit, I approached the subject of sterilization (23 y/o engaged female) because I had a horrible history with birth control and my then-current IUD made my legs numb and I've missed work/school from the pain it caused me. He said he would never put an IUD in someone without children and "if it ain't broke, why fix it?" even though it clearly was not a safe birth control method for my body. Never went back to him after that.

[Dr. Jorge Lopez] (https://health.usnews.com/doctors/jorge-lopez-484684#location) Tubal ligation and bilateral salpingectomy - Absolutely no questions asked as to why a patient requested the procedure. He explained various methods of sterilization. The Staff is extremely friendly. Dr. Lopez and all staff are bilingual (English and Spanish), which could be a great asset for anyone that you might know that only speaks Spanish.

[Dr Tim McAuliff](https://gentleproceduresdallas.com/) I had a no scalpel vasectomy, I'm 21, not married, and def haven't had kids. There's an appointment scheduling fee of $100, then it costs ~$480 for the actual procedure. Wait time was easy, they have the pharmacy for prescriptions in the same parking lot (cost like $30) and I didn't use insurance. He literally asked "you sure, if you have any questions I'll answer" and NO bingos at all. I was out in like an 1.5 hrs from walking in the door. 

+1 Dr Tim McAuliff, Dallas, texas, vasectomy, I’m 19 child free and he had me in and out in 30 minutes. Really cool doctor.

Dr. Uchechi Anumudu, BSW Dallas. It was 1 month exactly from my first appointment with her to my surgery date. She never bingoed me, and even held my hand while I fell asleep from the anesthesia before the procedure. I cannot say enough good things about her and would recommend her to anyone in the DFW area looking to undergo the Bisalp procedure. Everyone at the surgery center was also very kind.

**Denton**

[Dr. Caren Reaves MD, FACOG](https://cfwdenton.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Caren-C-Reaves-MD) Caring For Women. When asked, Dr Reaves advises, "18+--if they're old enough to die for this country, they're old enough to make informed decisions about their body that I will respect and uphold. Under the age of 25, I highly encourage the use of LARCs (IUD/Nexplanon) given they are almost as effective as sterilization yet non-permanent simply due to the rate of regret later but I will still respect her choice if it is sterilization. Over 25, will perform without a second of hesitation after informed consent." NB unfortunately this doctor is leaving active practice in November 2022. 

Laura Finger is with “Caring for Women” (940-591-6700), Tubal ligation for under 30yo CF.

I'm 30 yr and have seen Dr. Asis for nearly 10 years. Very friendly and since I had mentioned my desire to never have kids at most previous visits, he was not surprised that I want to get sterilized. He explained bi-salp to me, and his only concern was my hip microdermal piercings being near where the surgical incisions will be made. Understood why I want it done with no bingoing. 

**El Paso**

[Dr. Stephanie Mishaw](https://elpaso.ttuhsc.edu/som/obgyn/faculty.aspx). She's in El Paso, Texas. Dr. Mishaw is wonderful, everyone was. No pushback, just that I understood I wanted something permanent. Firm believers in autonomous choice. I want to hug her and I always will, even if I regret it someday. She's an amazing doctor and the pricetag on IVF is a lot lower than the one on the coathanger.

She was direct and to the point, I did not have to jump through any hoops and was able to get surgery a little over a month after seeing her. Practice accepts Medicaid.

Jamie Walker Erwin - 817-847-4600 and 817-923-0088 - Website: txhealthcare.com (Might have to search for her on the website) - Performs Tubals and Bilateral Salpingectomies if i'm not mistaken. No bingos, especially if you seem well educated and informed in what you want and why you want it and what it all entails. [Note from other user 2018/04/27 : Dr. Jamie Erwin is listed under Ft. Worth, TX so I called her office to make an appointment. I asked if she is willing to perform sterilization on someone under 30 without children. I was told that she would only do it if it’s a medical necessity. I decided not to make an appointment because of this. Maybe if I were already a patient and talked to her about it, it would be different.]

Dr. James Herd https://www.thcobgyn.com/our-physicians/james-herd-md/ Well-informed of current procedures, happy to discuss options, and was quick to offer bilateral salpingectomy when we both agreed it was the best option. Willing to sterilize 29/F, but also had a pre-existing doctor/patient relationship prior to the sterilization consult.

[Dr. Peter Irwin - OBGYN](http://www.peterirwinmd.com/) (Salpingectomy) [Note from other user 6/20/19: I (22F) met with Dr. Irwin earlier this month, and he refused to do the surgery. Just wanted to give the younger crowd a heads up so they don't waste their time like I did.]

[Dr. Alicia Larsen] (817) 924-2111 (http://www.txhealthcare.com/find-a-physician/alicia-larsen-md/80/) Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a 25 year old female with no prior children. Dr. Larsen, her office staff/nurses, and the nurses and anesthesiologists at Andrews Women’s Hospital at Baylor Scott and White all had wonderful bedside manner. No bingos from anyone and everyone was very friendly, informative, and attentive. Dr. Larsen and everyone involved in the surgery was very thorough and double and triple checked everything throughout the entire process. Dr. Larsen does the surgery herself and she did a great job based on the pictures taken from the laparoscopy and the easy healing process afterwards. Had only done a Pap smear with her once before and was a relatively new patient (3 months prior to surgery). 


+1 Dr Larsen, performed bilateral salpingectomy on an unmarried 29 F. 

[Dr. Bradley] (http://www.fortworthobgyn.com/) (Bi-Salp and Ablation) OB/GYN Note: There are 3 there, but the office is listed under Dr. English name. She's popular and probably has a long list so I went with Dr. Bradley. I went there as a first time paitent, never ever had a visit to a obgyn before, never had pap smears or any doctor history. He listens, doesn't bingo, and likes to be well informed. If you have problems with reproductive health he will try to figure out the problem just to have all bases covered. He may make recommendations for you but he will ultimately. He also doesn't seem against doing hysterrectomies either. He even does his best to work with your schdule. Overall great doctor who respects bodily autonomy!

[Dr Alison Pasciucco](https://www.unthsc.edu/patient-care/specialties/obstetrics-and-gynecology/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 28/29 @ time of surgery, Married, no children. Asked to try other methods for at least a few months to make sure it's what wanted. Didn't need husband's opinion, just made me verify multiple times that the surgery is what I wanted. Accepts Texas Healthy Women's so if you have that, the surgery should be free if not close to it

This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am a board certified Ob/Gyn practicing in Frisco TX. I have performed and will perform tubal sterilization for those requesting permanent contraception regardless of age or whether or not a woman already has children."

[Heather Bartos, MD, FACOG](https://beagreatwoman.com/providers/) from Be Women's Health and Wellness in Frisco, Texas. Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am 21, never had children, and am unmarried (single). Insurance covered 80% of the surgery, but i still had to pay about 2k out of pocket and i am paying off another 2k over the next 12 months. Dr. Bartos never tried to change my mind. The initial consultation lasted less than 10 minutes. She confirmed that i didn't want kids, and then talked through my surgery options before we scheduled a pre-op. The entire process was exactly 2 months. They wanted to do the surgery sooner, (less than 2 weeks after my initial consultation) i just couldn't afford it yet.

+1 Dr Bartos, I was a new patient and filled out the paperwork, it was so easy. I am a 22 yo F unmarried. I recieved zero pushback from her or the Medical assistant who did the initial stuff like BP measuring, etc. She will be doing a Bilateral Salpingectomy and removing my (displaced) IUD in the next few months. I travelled from Dallas to see her and she is work the trip on DNT! office is cozy and she did not question me at all, just made sure I was aware it was permanent, if I had been thinking about it for a long time, and asked if I would have transportation/ a support system since that would help things be easier for me (but she clarified that she did not care at all what my family, husband, the world etc thinks, its my body and decision). I am so excited! I recommend her.

[Dr. Preston Clay Alexander M.D.] (http://www.healthcentralobgyn.com/about-us/frisco-obgyn/clay-alexander-md/) (Bilateral Tubal Ligation) Performed tubal ligation with filshie clips on 25 year old female after one introductory consult. From intro appointment to pre-op appointment to completion of procedure was roughly one month.

[Dr. Pauline Petrovski](https://www.friscoobgyn.com/provider/pauline-petrovski-md) - bilateral salpingectomy June 2021 Me- Age 33, married, no children. When I asked about the subject of permanent birth control she simply explained my options, gave me the stats on regret for people my age, and told me to call the surgical coordinator when I'm ready to schedule. Within 3 months I was on the operating table. Not once did she question my reasons or even make mention of my husband. None of that "why doesn't he just get a vasectomy?" crap. The out of pocket quote for her surgical fee was about $3000 because she always operates in tandem with her colleague Dr. Bailey. The entire procedure including facility/anesthesiologist/labs probably amounted to about $20k but I only paid $900 out of pocket with my marketplace insurance plan.

**Gainesville** 

[Dr. Amy Klein](https://www.gainesvilleobgyn.net/?utm_source=gmb_auth) I am 25 and recieved a hysterectomy from her yesterday. She did ask multiple times if I was sure about getting the procedure done, but never tried to talk me out of it. I got a hysterectomy for endometriosis, but she made sure to say I could easily get a tubal if I couldn't get approved for a hysterectomy. All her staff was super friendly and no one made any comments about me choosing not to have children, if anything they said things about how it was a great idea, even though many of them have children. Overall I had a great experience, and getting the procedure done took all of 2 months. It would have been done quicker but I had to wait a few weeks due to issues with my own schedule.

**Georgetown** 

[Dr. Kelly Montiville](https://www.georgetowntexasobgyn.com/georgetown-obgyn-doctors/dr-kelly-montiville/). Bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 29, partnered-not-married, and childfree. No bingos at all, super fast, dealt with insurance for me, absolutely lovely place.

I (37yo child free female) was recently approved for and received a hysterectomy. Doc is very receptive to child free, did not try to talk me out of it; only presented me with my other options and the risks of each surgery with the explanation that hysterectomy has a longer recovery time and bigger risk for complications. He agreed to my sharing his information.

[Dr. Christopher Jayne in Houston, TX](https://greaterhoustonurogyn.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Christopher-J-Jayne-MD). Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy. I am 29, single, and nonbinary (I didn’t mention my gender identity in regards to this procedure.) I approached Dr. Jayne about the procedure in 2020, and he supported me in my desire to have a bilateral salpingectomy, but my insurance would only cover a ligation. I was adamant about the salpingectomy and didn’t have the money to pay out of pocket, so I didn’t have the procedure. I returned to Dr. Jayne, who was absolutely willing to perform the procedure (and specifically stated to me that he will perform the procedure on unmarried folks and those coming in from out of state.) I had my consult on a Wednesday, pre-op that Friday, and surgery on Monday. It was a very quick and easy process, and at no point I felt judgement or hesitation from Dr. Jayne in performing the procedure.

+1 Dr Jayne, No bingos, approved straightaway for a bilateral salpingectomy. 29F, no kids. Smooth process from start to finish.

[Dr. Kayla Lash, MD OBGYN]( https://womanshospital.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Kayla-Lash-MD) Complete Women’s Care Center 7900 Fannin St., Ste 3000, Houston, TX, 77054, (713) 791-9100. Doctor’s Statement: I’m an OBGYN and happy  to do surgical sterilizations! (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy with or without IUD or ablation if needed). Dr. notes that online scheduling is usually booked out later than actual availability, so call and leave a message with her office asking for a consult. They will call back with next available. Does not take Medicaid/Medicare. Practice is LBGTQ+ friendly.

+1 Dr Lash, sterilized 26-year-old redditor, who was very happy with her care.

+1 Dr. Lash! I'm a 25 year old trans man who's been on HRT and she made me feel really comfortable--despite it being a women-focused practice, she made sure to read my chart and only asked about trans-related care to make sure I had an endocrinologist monitoring my hormone therapy. Any questions regarding my partner were framed in a way that was to make sure I was in a safe and healthy relationship and that it would be okay to disclose post-op care to them. I was able to book online for a consult and was able to get her nearest surgery date after I went home on the same day--about a two week wait. Super pleasant experience!

+1 Dr. Lash. Nov 2022. Bisalp on 20-year-old redditor.

+1 Dr. Kayla Lash. 37F. No children. Approved for laparoscopic hysterectomy with no bingos the same day. I couldn't be happier. Dr. Lash listened to my concerns and never was dismissive.

[Dr. Carrie Ball](https://www.obgynmedicalcenter.com/doctors/dr-carrie-j-ball/). Bilateral Salpingectomy/Removal of the adnexal structures this past Friday. 32, single, childfree. No bingos or pushback. I've been seeing Dr. Ball since I was a teenager and she has always supported whatever birth control I wanted to use. The procedure itself was only 45 minutes, but I was in the hospital from 6am - about 1pm doing pre-op beforehand plus recovering afterwards. No complications. The procedure was scheduled pretty quickly after I had my initial consultation appointment. So far, I've only paid about a $130 co-pay to Dr. Ball - not sure if I will get any other bills. Recovery hasn't been too bad. Dr. Ball gave me a prescription for actual pain medication. The nurse followed up with me a few days later to see how I was doing, and I have a follow-up appointment scheduled for a few weeks from now. Excited that it's all over!

[Jennie Ou, MD](https://www.kelsey-seybold.com/find-a-houston-doctor/jennie-park-ou-obgyn), this gynecologist has contacted us directly to advise, "I strongly believe in contraception choice, and will counsel on the risk of regret and alternative options, but do perform L/S BL salpingectomies when desired regardless of how many children they have had (even if 0) or age (as long as >21yo)— as long as they are safe for surgery. I do not judge patients for their reproductive choices." Our members need to fully understand their anatomy and the implications and permanency of sterilisation before they will be approved. NB "I have BCBS Health Select of Texas (through a state agency) and was told I could only have my insurance applied to the visits with Dr. Jennie Ou if my PCP was a provider at the Kelsey-Seybold clinic. Otherwise it would all be out of pocket. " 

Dr. Rikki Baldwin is great with any type of gynecological tests or procedures needed. As soon as I started interest in sterilization, 30yo CF, she was like "okay, when would you like to schedule?" No questions or comments about regret - really great! Dr. Rikki Baldwin is located at Memorial Hermann Northwest (Cypress, TX which is Northwest Houston). I received a bi salp without any questions or issues when it came to scheduling or billing. 

+1 Dr Baldwin, 24F, Single, No Children Procedure: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy Statement: Dr. Baldwin was incredibly sweet and just asked me a single question to make sure it was something I had thought about. No bingos. She was ready to do the procedure the same week of my consultation! The procedure itself went very smoothly, incisions were beautiful, recovery was quick and overall I would absolutely recommend her.

[Dr. Theresa Robinson, M.D. - Women's Health Group](http://womanshealthgroup.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Theresa-L-Robinson) (Tubal) Will probably not do tubal on someone under 25 but at 25 and older she has stated she has no problems with sterilization of a woman without children. Very professional. Considered to have "no bed-side manner" but she is a thorough and good doctor who will take the time to answer any questions for anything. No questions asked on why I did not want children and did not require an explanation beforehand. Simply walked in, asked if I would like to discuss birth control, I said sterilization. She offered other forms and let me know all of my options. Once rejected she said to call and schedule an appointment for surgery. 

-1 Dr Robinson, a 24yo member attempted consultation, was denied. As above, do not consult with this doctor if you're younger than 25. 

[Dr. Alan Hananel, M.D. - Houston Metro Urology](http://www.hmutx.com/bio_hananel.php) (Vasectomy) I walked in and said that I wanted a vasectomy at the age of 19. This doctor required some persuasion, and asked me a myriad of questions regarding my reasons for wanting this procedure, my family, did I know this is considered permanent, etc. He told me that he has performed this procedure on patients as young as 17. If he thinks the patient is of sound mind and has put sufficient time and thought into this, and that they are truly convinced, he will have no problems performing the procedure. He is very professional, he knows what he is doing, and his bedside manner is good. He is happy to answer any questions a patient may have. He is very relaxed and calm and makes efforts to make his patients feel the same. I did not feel judged at any point by him or his staff. Cost was ~$550.

[Dr. Daniel Mundy — Memorial Hermann](http://www.memorialhermann.org/doctors/ob-gyns/dr-daniel-mundy-md-1315/) (Bilateral Salpingectomy). For a consultation, took some friendly discussion on my reasoning for wanting the BS procedure, but I think my age (30), already knowing a good deal about the procedure I wanted specifically, having internalized all the reasons to be CF, and reassurance that I wouldn't regret it, he seemed convinced that I understood all the risks and consequences, and agreed to do it. We discussed insurance coverage, and I was to call back later to set up the surgery date. The surgery went perfectly. In the follow-up appointment, he even gave me a laparoscopy photo to keep since I couldn't keep my tubes! Even the areas he cut looked neat and professional, and the incisions are super tiny. Very happy with the results. 

+1 Dr Mundy: performed a bilateral salp on me at age 26.

+1 Dr Mundy: 26F, no kids, no health issues. Dr. Mundy performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me. When we met for a birth control consultation, I told him I wanted a bi-salp, and he was very open to having that conversation with me to make sure I was serious, knew that it was permanent, and to make sure it wouldn't be something I would regret. No bingos, just a friendly conversation about it since this was the first time he met me. He was very respectful of my decision and mentioned that I'm old enough to know myself and what I want. All around great experience with him and the nurses and surgery team.

[Dr. Chapman - Pearland Urology in Houston](https://www.pearlandurology.com/) (Vasectomy on 20M, childfree, single.) I use CIGNA and my deductible was met so the procedure + consultation was $130. I can't recommend this doctor enough. He was perfect, zero bingos. What he pretty much told me was,"If you're here for a vasectomy then you're getting your vasectomy".  Also, he's incredibly skilled and uses the no-needle no-scalpel method, I'd put the pain of the procedure at a 1/10 just for the slight discomfort of administering the local anesthetic which he used a special device with no needle that felt like nothing more than a pinch.

+1 Dr Chapman (Vasectomy)

+1 [Dr. Chapman - Pearland Urology](https://www.pearlandurology.com/no-needle-no-scalpel-vasectomy/). Awesome service, in and out for the consult and procedure within the same week. His no scalpel process had me up and in no time. 33 years old, No kids, No Wife.

+1 Dr Chapman, gave me, a 24 year old, unmarried, child free man, a no needle no scalpel vasectomy and was absolutely perfect throughout. Made sure to stress that it was permanent but at no point tried to bingo me or dissuade me from proceeding, and trusted me to make my own decision from the get go.

[Dr. Brandi Ring](https://psidirectory.com/listing/brandi-ring-md-facog-fawm.html). Specifically stated that it's the individual's choice and right to get sterilized, supports it as early as insurance will allow it. Very supportive & friendly. Performs tubals/salpingectomies, also offers other permanent/semipermanent methods. 

[Dr. Jennifer Bump](https://www.texaschildrens.org/find-a-doctor/jennifer-m-m-bump-md) Texas Children's Hospital 6651 Main St, Houston, TX 77030 (832) 826-7500. 
Bilateral Salpingectomy completed in November 2021 - 34 year old childfree, married female, no medical problems. Dr. Bump was attentive and caring. No bingos. Did not ask for my reasons to be childfree. Surgery was scheduled within a couple of weeks after consultation. Procedure and recovery went well. I asked her if she would have sterilized someone 10 years younger than me and she said yes, as long as the individual was certain in their decision. I told her about the Reddit list of childfree friendly doctors and she said she would be happy to be referred to.

[Dr. Carolyn Kenney](https://www.baobgyn.com/carolyn-kenney-do-facog.html) - She performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me today! I’m 23, childfree, not married, but in a long-term relationship. The process was super easy, no judgement whatsoever from her or anyone else involved. Insurance completely covered the procedure.

+1 Dr Kenney, I am 24, unmarried, no kids! There were no gotchas (she did have to give me a short spiel to make sure I was absolutely certain I wanted this, but it was respectful and necessary) and the Texas Healthy Women program covered the surgery. Dr. Kenney also removed some endometriosis during the laparoscopy.

[Tamisa Koythong, MD](https://women.texaschildrens.org/provider/tamisa-koythong-md) Texas Children’s Pavilion for Women 6651 Main St. Ste 320 Houston, Texas 77030.

Dr Koythong will begin consulting at the following location in August: Texas Children’s Pavilion for Women Obstetrics & Gynecology Pearland 9003 Broadway St. Pearland, TX 77584

+1 Dr Koythong, Consult and pre-op were incredibly smooth, next to no waiting, no bingos or extra steps I had to take. No push back from her. Surgery was also incredibly smooth. The care team that day was amazing, recovery so far has been very good, and my insurance (Cigna/NALC) covered the procedure fully.

[Dr. Michael Piegari](https://www.memorialhermann.org/doctors/ob-gyns/dr-michael-piegari-md-1285857714) @ Memorial Hermann TMC. Bilateral salpingectomy. 34, Single, No kids then, now, or ever! The same day I asked about the procedure (1st time) he had his scheduler get in contact to schedule me. They called my insurance to check coverage beforehand so I didn’t have to - 100% covered!! Could have done it as quickly as 2 weeks later. He made me feel comfortable, prepared, and empowered. Never doubted or questioned my decision, only cared that I felt it was the best decision for me. Personally calls for post-op check-ins and available 24/7 by text! Arrival - discharge 3.5 hours!

I made my first ever appointment with Dr. Zavala on January 24th, and she performed my laparoscopic tubal ligation on February 23rd. She did not ask me if I was married, just confirmed that I was absolutely positive about my decision at my first appointment and that was it. It was easy, my surgery went perfectly and I recovered quickly with no complications whatsoever. Dr. Zavala is professional, efficient, and straightforward - this process was insanely easy and it was so great to finally get a doctor to say yes after asking for the last 5 years.

**Irving** 

[Dr Brian Enggano](https://macarthurmc.com/dr-brian-enggano/) - Dr Enggano did my bilateral salpingectomy in 2020 when I was 24. He'll ask if this is your decision alone and if this is truly what you want, but he won't try to sway you or deny you based on age or marital status. He also stated during our visit that he believes this is entirely a patient's decision and no one else's.

[Dr. Elia Fanous](https://macarthurmc.com/dr-elia-fanous/) MacArthur Medical Center Performed tubal. 28, unmarried, no kids. He will ask the usual question but he is super objective and is an amazing doctor overall. Communicates thoroughly and well, very comfortable to talk to, has great staff.

**Jacksonville** 

[Dr. Harsh Adhyaru](https://uthealtheasttexas.com/provider/harsh-adhyaru-md) - bilateral salpingectomy & endometrial ablation to stop my extremely heavy periods since I wanted to get off hormonal birth control. Had 2 appointments with him before my surgery, whole process took less than 6 months. He did not BINGO me at all but he did ask the typical questions to make sure & to also make sure I understood the surgery & outcome. Out of all the doctors I experienced rejecting me over 5 years of asking in East Texas he was the nicest.

Bisalp on 24-year-old CF redditor. The doctor asked the standard questions: How long have you known you didn't want kids? Are you married? Do your parents agree? What if you meet the right one?

**Lewisville**

[Dr. Munira Dudhbhai - Lewisville Women's Care] (https://lewisvillewomenscare.com/)  (Bilateral Salpingectomy, Tubal Ligation) Age 29, visited to request sterilization on initial consultation/meeting with Dr. Dudhbhai. Talked my through the procedures (ligation vs salpingectomy), recommended the bilateral salpingectomy for me, and we got it scheduled. Didn't ask about partner at all until an after thought shortly before we scheduled the procedure. Went out of her way to get me scheduled quickly. Only asked if I was sure of my decision a couple times to ensure she was following procedure for all permanent sterilizations. [Side note: Office is right across the parking lot from the hospital, and the hospital was also fantastic! Not a single bingo.] (FYI, her name is pronounced "Dubai") --

-1 From a different patient: 23F, I approached her during my appointment to ask about sterilization and she became rude and the rest of the appointment was bingos so I would recommend younger patients to look elsewhere unfortunately!  

+1 Dr. Dudhbhai - Dec 2022. Bisalp on 31-year-old redditor. She has been a literal gift from heaven. She made it so easy and was so kind, respectful, and empathetic throughout the whole process.

I am registered with ACOG, ABOG, Google, Health Grades, even have an Instagram acct. I note myself to be LGBTQ friendly and an ally. I perform bilateral salpingectomies for sterilization. I also provide many forms of contraception including iuds for women who have never had children. I accept most insurances but my staff are friendly with inquiries. I encourage all patients to apply for texas healthy women (a subsidiary of medicaid) as that may reduce costs to zero dollars. Most of my patients are Texans or from New Mexico. I am child free myself so I "get it" and have been on "both sides" of the consultation. I have virtually no limitations except a verbalization that the patient understands this is permanent, irreversible, no take-backs, etc. I ask about family support to help give the patient support if needed, or to maintain confidentiality about the procedure if it impacts the patient's safety or wellbeing (this is not meant to be a deterrent, rather a safety issue for some patients who cannot disclose their birth control method).

Bisalp and endometrial uterine ablation on 29-year-old CF redditor. He did ask if it weren’t for my bad periods would I still be on birth control. I said yes and he said okay, he just had to ask. That was the only question asked and he went ahead and scheduled the surgery for a few weeks later. Clinic does not accept Medicaid.

Dr. Ferenc Markos (https://www.chistlukeshealth.org/dr-ferenc-markos-md-obstetrics-and-gynecology-77205) (Agreed to do a tubal before age 30, no judgment) 

-1 Dr Markos, First, he tried to convince me to just stick to the pill. Asked me what I would do if my partner wanted kids. Told me that he couldn't do it at the hospital since it's a Catholic hospital. Told me if I regret it that IVF is very expensive and followed it up asking what my career was, obviously trying to sus out if I could afford IVF if I had regrets. To cap it off, he asked if I had told my parents about this. I'm sure I'm forgetting what else he said to me, but rather than feeling relief after, I felt overwhelmed and anxious. I technically got "approval" for it at an outside surgery center, but will likely seek a different doctor after that experience. While he did eventually approve, I think people will need to be ready to defend their choice when discussing with this doctor rather than expecting a smooth agreement.

[Dr. Miguel A. Mercado] (https://www.texasurologyspecialists.com/locations/the-woodlands) (vasectomy) Did my vasectomy at 26 with no kids. Had my consultation and returned two weeks later for the procedure.

[Dr. Elizabeth Coronado, Women's Specialists of Plano](https://obgynplano.com/womens-doctors-physicians/elizabeth-coronado-md/). Bi-salp, on a single woman, age 24. She is very honest and no-nonsense. Agreed to do it immediately after I explained my reasons. The entire process took only 2 months from having my consultation to getting the surgery scheduled to having it performed, but her office can get busy so expect to wait a month or so for that initial consultation.

[Dr. Iwrin Endleman](https://endelmanobgyn.com/), in Plano, TX, did my Essure insertion when I was on my mid-20s. I was single and had no children. I had my mom with me but she didn't even need to speak up for me. When I asked about sterilization, he immediately started telling me my options.

[Dr. Fleming, Plano, TX](https://www.pwhcare.com/doctors/dr-berry-fleming/) 28f tubal ligation + ablation. When I asked about sterilization, he said I'm assuming you've thought about this before yesterday and are certain you don't want kids. I said yes and he immediately started telling me the options for sterilization. No bingoing at all, and by the end of my first appointment with him we were scheduling the next steps for surgery.

[Dr. Stephanie Michel] (https://www.womenshealthtx.com/oakwood-womens-centre/)
Tubal ligation. Incredibly professional with a great sense of humor. Best OBGYN I've ever had. I moved 20 miles away and still go back to her. Quick procedure, small and discreet scar, and super nice follow up conversation same day. 

[Women's Health Texas (Austin)](https://austinobgyn.womenshealthtx.com/oakwood-womens-centre/) Address of location: 511 Oakwood Blvd #301, Round Rock, Texas 78681 Phone #: (512)244-3698. Doctor #1: Dr. Mary Harrison, was supposed to perform surgery but gave birth the day before so a different provider (below) performed surgery Doctor #2: Dr. Paul Murphree, was the one to perform the surgery without commenting on me being young, but was not my original provider. No bingo from either doctor, was a quick and easy process. 

[Kathryn Anger, MD](http://austinobgyn.womenshealthtx.com/provider/kathryn-anger-md/) Location: 511 Oakwood Boulevard #301, Round Rock, Texas 78681 Phone: (512) 244-0214. Laparoscopic tubal ligation Age: 27 Marital status: Single Childfree status: 0 children. Dr. Anger is amazing! While she did warn me that younger, childless individuals tend to regret sterilization and that the procedure is permanent, she said that it is ultimately my choice and she would be supportive of my decision. It took about two months from my initial birth control consultation (Sept 10, 2021) meeting to my surgery date (Oct 29, 2021). My employer-provided insurance covered the procedure in full. My only out-of-pocket costs were ~$150 total for the two pre-op office visits and the post-op pain killers. I had the surgery on a Friday and was back at work by Monday.

Obviously, each case is uniquely and beautifully different and requires careful and respectful consultation. BUT your desire to remain childfree should ultimately be YOUR choice if we truly want to talk about respecting autonomy.”

[Ritu Dutta, MD](https://baptistmedicalnetwork.com/ritu-dutta-md/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. 31, Married, No kids. We talked about the permanent nature of the procedure (no reversals on bisalp), how I'd need IVF if I ever wanted to have bio-kids, and that my periods would likely become heavier (I previously had Mirena). I mentioned that I had my husband on telephone standby, just in case he had to give his consent (test question) and she told me I was fully capable of deciding what I want to do with my body. She approved me after one ~10-15 minute visit.. I have Tricare Select, total procedure cost was $400 out of pocket

[Dr. Ricardo Munoz](http://www.riverwalkobgyn.com/physicians.html) I'm 32, childfree, and single. I had a bilateral salpingectomy. I would highly recommend it, I told him I wanted one and he asked me if I was sure. I said yes, he said ok that he just wanted to check. And then started explaining the medical details to me. I didn't have to justify my choice to him at all. He was professional and was good at following up when I had a question after surgery. My surgery was scheduled 2 weeks after I had my appointment with him. My insurance covered 80%, I'll end up paying around $2500 and am on a payment plan.

JAN 2022. Doctor requested addition to the list. LBGTQ+ friendly. Procedures: tubal ligation, contraception management, hysterectomy “I am an OBGYN in San Antonio, TX and provide tubal ligations to patients who desire permanent sterilization, as well as hysterectomies and other therapies to those who have conditions such as painful periods, heavy periods, prolonged periods, endometriosis, fibroids, and other gynecologic conditions.

[Dr. Felipe Garcia-Ghinis](https://acaciaobgyn.com/meet-our-team/felipe-garcia-ghinis-md-facog/). bilateral salpingectomy in early 2020 Age: 34 Childfree Status: no prior pregnancies; willfully childfree Marital Status: Unmarried at the time, but in LTR. On my first visit to this practice, I asked for a tubal. The doctor confirmed I had no prior pregnancies and did not intend to have children in the future. It was not an uncomfortable conversation I do not recall him asking about or mentioning my now-husband. He said he typically recommended Mirena because it is less invasive, but also explained the bilateral salpingectomy (and how it differs from a tubal ligation) and left the decision up to me. When I told him my choice, I met no resistance and I was scheduled for the bisalp within the month.

[Dr. Lynn Parente at NE OBGYN](https://ne-obgyn.com/doctors/), hysterectomy for a 40yo. It is unclear if this doctor is willing to operate on an elective basis or on younger people at this stage. 

[Dr. Katherine Cornforth](https://www.cornforthgyn.com/). She has performed many kinds of surgeries and she does bilateral salpingectomy (no tubal clamping or anything like that). She also does all other kinds of birth control consultations if that is an area of interest for some people (like IUDs). Insurance wise, you might want to call ahead and check to make sure she takes what you might have or see if she is in your network. I don't know if she does sliding scale payments. I'm in my early 30s & I've never had a child. She understood my fear of pregnancy (even allowing me to have a copper IUD and stay on the pill). She is going to be doing my bi-salp in the next few months. When I first asked her if she needed spousal permission or anything like that she basically was like "heck no" lol. She's very pro- woman and women's choice. Never bingoed me at all. NB this doctor *may* need members to try a LARC first. 

[Dr. Orlando Suris, at Methodist Stone Oak Hospital](https://sanantonioobgyn.womenshealthtx.com/provider/orlando-suris-san-antonio-tx/) Gyno Office: Women's Health Texas Lincoln Heights (210) 656-3040. He's amazing. Such a sweet beside manner and people at the hospital raved about his skill. I'm 36F, single, no kids, and had mentioned to him briefly before about wanting this done, but made a separate consultation appointment the day after Texas enacted the six week ban. He was immediately willing to get me scheduled, and stopped me when I thought he needed to hear all my reasons. I was so relieved at how easy it was. It cost about $7k total.

[Dr. Thomas Rozanski](http://www.uthscsa.edu/patient-care/physicians/providers/1356350797/Thomas-Rozanski) Did my vasectomy at 24. Required two consultations (1 month apart) due to my age and the potential legal liability. Professional, didn't ask for my reasons, clearly explained the risks. Quick procedure.

[Dr. Carlos Cardenas - Concierge Medicine](https://www.drcvip.com/?utm_source=gmb_auth) (Bilateral Salpingectomy, Tubal) At age 26, I visited Dr. Cardenas to request an IUD but after the conversation turned to my lack of children and deep desire to never bear any, he literally just asked 'well, how about a tubal ligation instead?'  For the sake of legal liability Dr. Cardenas scheduled two pre-op visits to ensure no second-thoughts, then preformed the surgery himself via laparoscopy.  Most notable:  He shut down an intake nurse at the surgical suite mid-bingo and grinned while doing it. 2nd recommendation: I’m a 29, female, who is single. No long-term partner at this time. I had a tubal ligation. Dr. Cardenas is phenomenal. He never questioned my decision and answered any questions I had regarding the procedure. I had one appointment to schedule the surgery, one pre-op appointment, and then I was at the hospital having surgery. I will continue to see him as my OBGYN.

+1 Dr Cardenas did my tubal and endometrial ablation when I was 22 (no kids obviously). It was a wonderful experience and I cannot recommend him enough!

I was 29 at the time of my visit, so it's possible she does have some age restriction for sterilization, I'm not sure.  She has always been very honest and objective with me in the many years I've been seeing her as my GYN.

At age 24, I went and asked about having a bilateral salpingectomy, and without bingoing or asking more than a few questions she agreed to set up a surgery date. She did an amazing job with the surgery as well. She did say that 24 is the lowest she would accept though.

[Dr. Lisa Ng](https://acaciaobgyn.com/meet-our-team/lisa-lee-ng-do/). 7940 Floyd Curl Drive, Medical Tower II, Suite 900, San Antonio, TX 78229. Bilateral salpingectomy. I visited this doctor as a new patient for my yearly exam and discussed wanting a bilateral salpingectomy. Her website profile notes that she specializes in laparoscopic and minimally invasive gynecological surgery. She listened supportively while I explained my reasons and said that my fertility is my choice and that I seemed well informed on what I wanted. She agreed to perform the procedure during that first visit with no bingos, and I had my procedure scheduled before I left the office.

IG @drmelzamora FB. Doctor’s statement: “I am practicing physician who desires to help any woman interested in sterilization or any form of contraceptive, management of reproductive health issues. Please add me to the list of available physicians. I support you all.”

Luke Newton, MD, an OBGYN at the UT health San Antonio hospital, zero bingos, entirely supportive, had childfree staff, actually listened to me, took less than 4 weeks from consult to surgery, I was 19F when I got approved for my bisalp and had it when I turned 20 a few weeks later.

Dr. Elizabeth King in San Antonio. I had met her to establish myself with her office after moving back to the city and not having had a doxtoe here. During the appointment, i brought up sterilization and she had me scheduled me for surgery that day (to clarify, I visited in August and on the day of my first visit, she had me down for the surgery in October). She was very professional, very straight forward, and did well explaining what options I had in terms of sterilization.

**Sugar Land** 

John Boon, MD 16651 Southwest Freeway Medical Office Building 1, Suite 310 Sugar Land, Texas 77479. Very friendly with great bedside manner. Answered all of my questions and didn't give me any trouble, only clarified that I knew it was permanent and reversal isn't guaranteed to work. No scalpel vasectomy available. Was free with insurance. Appointments were quick and easy and whole procedure only took about 20 minutes.

**Temple** 

Dr. Christopher Birkholz, MD and he is located at the Baylor Scott & White Clinic- Temple Professional Plaza II in Temple, Texas. He approved and scheduled my tubal at our very first appointment together! 

Dr. Jessica Langsjoen, MD at the Baylor Scott and White Clinic - Temple, 2401 South 31st Street, Temple Texas 76508. 24, single. Various surgical methods offered. Dr. Langsjoen has a busy schedule, but I asked for bisalp and she scheduled it ASAP. She said she's happy to do this surgery for people who want it. She also told me to not to humor anyone who is not respectful of my decision.

**Waco** 

[Dr Hannah Ermon](https://www.bswhealth.com/physician/hannah-ermon) I'm mid 30sf, no kids, no partner, but Dr. Ermon didn't even ask. No bingos, no hoops. Just standard risks of surgery. She was kind, patient, and didn't rush me at all with my questions. I asked if I could share her information which she seemed glad to know this existed, and agreed. Will NOT sterilise below 21, use with caution if below 25. She was absolutely wonderful for me.

**Weatherford**

Dr. April Mikes D.O. - Ob/Gyn - http://www.weatherfordobgyn.com - Bilateral Lapriscopic Salpingectomy 

**Webster** 

[Dr. Helen Rhodes](http://www.drhelenrhodes.com/) in Webster, TX. (Near Houston). I am 32 years old, common law married, and childless. I received a Bisalp. Excellent surgeon. I changed gynos, and at my first visit with her before the exam I discussed getting sterilized. She did ask why (I mentioned being childfree, the lack of options now, and my partner and me being on the same page), and the only thing she did mention was that she couldn't help with period cramps via IUD if I went this route. I was scheduled within a month of my first appointment!

###UTAH

**American Fork**

[Dr. Tiffany Spencer - Valley OBGYN](http://valleyobgynutah.com/portfolio/tiffany-m-spencer-n-p/) (Tubal Ligation) Kids weren't even brought up. I asked her about the possibility of getting a tubal ligation once my IUD was up in a year, and she just made sure I wasn't counting on the possibility of having it reversed/knew it was permanent, and also made sure I knew I couldn't be a surrogate for anyone else if I was sterilized. 

-1 Dr Spencer, "Today I messaged the clinic she's at (now called Valley Women's Health) and I was told that she does not do sterilizations"

**Bountiful** 

[Ryan Empey](https://mountainstar.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Ryan-B-Empey-MD) Bilateral salpingectomy 19, single, pretty sure I'm childfree I'm 19, and he is probably my favorite doctor I've ever seen. His only stipulation is you must be 18, but besides that there were zero bingos, and I have 2 others friends who are getting the procedure from him too! He did remind me there are options in the future if I change my mind later, but that's about it.

**Bluffdale** 

[Dr. Mitchell Barney at South Valley Women's Health in Bluffdale, Utah.](https://svwhc.com/), 28F, married, no children, bilateral salpingectomy. Dr. Barney is amazing, did not ask any intrusive questions or say anything to guilt me into not receiving the procedure. Never once asked for my husband's opinion either. He was very kind, professional, and supportive throughout the whole process. Would recommend him to anyone.

**Draper**

[Dr. Carrie Sloan - Loan Peak OBGYN](http://lonepeakobgyn.com/physicians/profile/Carrie-L-Sloan-MD) 96 Kimballs Lane, Building 3, Ste 202, Draper, UT 84020. Asked thoughtful questions when I told her we did not want kids and I needed birth control that worked with my health issues. Non-judgmental, seemed unfazed by our decision, and helped me a great deal. Takes several types of insurance.

**Logan** 

[Dr. Brynn Schumacher](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/budge-obgyn/). I am 24, not married. I requested a bilateral salpingectomy. She asked a couple of questions about birth control but ultimately said that it’s my personal decision and she’ll do it if I’m sure. The appointment was very short and easy and I didn’t even have to argue any points other than I’m sure it’s what I want. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the surgery due to my insurance not covering the only hospital she operates in, but had no issues getting the surgery scheduled in the first place.

+1 Dr Schumacher, F[30], no children and married. Dr. Brynn Schumacher did a bi-salpingectomy. My initial appointment was really easy. We talked about doing an ablation too, which she was open to doing as well. Informed about regret and asked about my husband. She did not ask if I had permission from him or anything related—just if he was aware of the procedure. Scheduled surgical appointment same day. Surgery was quick, not a lot of pain, and all involved were very communicative and supportive. Total time from arrival to departing was 4.5 hours. Insurance covered almost everything and we paid about 700. Would absolutely recommend her.

**Murray** 

[Dr. Stephanie Henderson](https://www.grangermedical.com/providers/stephanie-henderson-md/) in Murray, UT. I have no kids, and she didn’t try to talk me out of it in any way. I went in to my consultation with a binder ready, but didn’t need it. She said it was my choice and as long as I’m sure, she had no problem. Surgery was excellent and she and her entire staff were extremely kind. 24F bilateral salpingectomy. 

+1 Dr. Stephanie Henderson, OBGYN, Granger Medical Murray, Utah. 29F, no children, long-term relationship but not married. Bilateral Tubal Ligation. I went in for a consult as a new patient, told her what I wanted and she brought up vasectomy as an option, I let her know I wanted full control of my own body and not rely on a partner. She said “let’s get you scheduled then, you are an adult and can make your own choices”. I could have scheduled 2 weeks out but waited until fall weather. Insurance covered 100% (Cigna). 10/10 recommend.

**Ogden/Layton**

[Dr. Kirk Lammi - Ogden Clinic Womens Health Ceneter]https://www.ogdenclinic.com/providers/lammi-kirk). His main office is at the Makay-Dee hospital on Harrison BLV As in the link provided. I saw Dr.Anna Marie Jones in the same office, and she was totally okay with sterlization on anyone over 21. She refered me to Dr. Lammi as my surgeon. They perfer to do a salpingectomy rather than just 'tying tubes' to prevent future problems, they said they cannot do full hystorectomies unless there is a significant problem. Dr. Lammi keeps it real and has to have verbal comfrimation that you do not want kids and then written comfrimation that he explained to you that you will not be able to have children, after that. But they only asked the questions they HAD to, no futher questions and the whole team is happy to help you! I techniqually got a refereal to see him, but I dont think one is needed to see Dr. Jones or any other doctor in the Womans Health clinic.

[Dr. Sharon Fillerup - Tanner Clinic] (https://tannerclinic.com/providers/sharon-fillerup-m-d/) (Tubal/Essure) Was referred by my PCP specifically because he knew she was CF. During consultation I told her I wanted to be sterilized--as an unmarried, healthy, 25 year old female. She scheduled me for the VERY NEXT WEEK!! She was only willing to do a tubal w/ Essure coils and declined a Salpingectomy, however. My surgery was ultimately cancelled last minute because the hospital she operates out of (I believe  Davis Surgical Center/Hospital?) was out of network for my insurance. Dr. Fillerup has since retired. 

[Dr. Bryant Johnson - Tanner Clinic] (https://tannerclinic.com/provider/bryant-johnson-do/) 1756 Antelope Drive, Layton, Utah 84041, 801-733-4840.  Made an appointment, no referral needed. Said he believes that women are adults, and can make their own decisions! No bingos, no questions asked. I already had a bilateral salplingectomy, he said if I hadn't had one done and only had the ligation, he would have suggested we just remove the tubes. He says his only requirement is that a woman comes in knowing that it's non-reversable and that they are 21. Willing to do salplingectomys and ablations. 

+1 Dr Johnston. Dec. 2021. Performed a bisalp surgery on me (21f). He was very professional and I never received any bingos from him. On my first visit with him when I brought up that I was looking to get sterilized he just asked me for my reasonings, said that he was obligated to make sure that I was certain. He said he was obligated to tell me that some women do regret the decision, but that it's not very common, that I am an adult and if I know I want this surgery, he had no problem doing it.

+1 Dr. Bryant Johnson is a patient advocate gynecologist. He only asked me my reason to get sterilized and made sure I knew it was a permanent decision. No bingos. He is willing to sterilize women over 21 via bilateral salpingectomy. I had my consultation 1 week after my 21st birthday in October and my surgery was scheduled December 21, 2021. Some of the rooms at the Tanner clinic are decorated with graphic watercolors of birth, yuck. But I still recommend Dr. Bryant Johnson.

+1 Dr Johnston, I'm 22, a college student, and unmarried, but Dr. Johnson was so accepting and understanding. His exact words were along the lines of, "I can do it, so long as you're 100% certain." I was, so he did it! 1 month from consult to surgery for OP. 

**Orem**

[Dr. Malcom C Masteller - Orem Parkway Clinic](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0076815) (Vasectomy) He verified that I don't want kids and that was it, one the nurses that assisted in the procedure was even CF as well.  Got me in for the procedure very quickly and without hassle.

**Provo**

[Dr. Stewart T. Landau - Utah Valley Urology](http://www.utahvalleyurology.net/stewert-t-landau-m-d/)(Vasectomy) Didn't bat an eye when I said I didn't want kids. First visit consult, booked appointment for procedure at the end.

[Dr. Tina Goldsmith-Hedin](https://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/kristina-hedin-goldsmith-0f7643f5-0e89-4662-9990-9d3b5b3d144c-overview). I'm 25, no children, married (but I don't think it mattered). Was able to speak to Tina for a quick referral to her surgeon, Dr. Wray. Her only objection was that the IUD is highly effective and it would be an easier surgery for my husband to get. But after we explained that I'm certain I never want children and it would bring me peace of mind, we were full steam ahead. The whole medical team supported my decision and I had a great experience.

**Saint George**

[Southwest Urology](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/southwest-urology-clinic/), (Its located in the Intermountain State Hospital)
M(26) Got snipped 5/23/2019 and doc said he had a 19 yr guy do the same. Asked the questions "you know this is permanent?, what if your perfect future wife wants kids? I replied I understand its permanent. And my perfect wife wont want kids. He laughed and said that's exactly what i would say. Good provider with no issues.

[Dr. Jeff Rogers](https://www.stgeorgesurgical.com/). Double salpingectomy, 25 year old female, married and childfree. Dr. Rogers was nothing short of amazing. He asked if I was married, but never spoke to my husband about the procedure. He initially spoke with me on the phone in a short 6 minute conversation and agreed to do the surgery then. He said studies show that women who are under the age of 30, married, and have no children are more at risk of regretting sterilization. I told him that wasn't what I'd read in my studies. He said it seemed like I had done my research and that if it was what I truly wanted that he would help me as he believed that I was the keeper of my own destiny. 

**Salt Lake City**

[Michelanne Shields,MD](https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/michelanne-shields)  University of Utah Hospital Department of OB/GYN, 50 N Medical Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, 801-213-9500. March 2023. Bisalp on 36-year-old redditor. She has been nothing but supportive through this whole process. Definitely an ally.

[Dr. Sean Edmunds](https://mountainstar.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Sean-F-Edmunds-MD), located in Salt Lake City, UT. Procedure: bilateral salpingectomy My info: 24 years old, single, childfree. Everyone was very friendly and there weren't any major wait times. One semi bingo, the doctor opened the consult that it may be regretted by those under 35. I confirmed I'd done my research and this is what I wanted (those exact words) and that was all he needed. He never tried to persuade me to not go forward with it and confirmed he's had lots of patients come to him after being rejected by other doctors. Surgery was scheduled for two weeks later, would have been the next week but he was already fully booked for then.

[Dr Rixt Luikenaar](https://www.rebirthobgyn.com/?utm_source=gmb_auth) - Received bisalp and uterine ablation at age 26, single, no children. Dr was very open and explained multiple permanent surgical solutions, mentioned being completely fine performing sterilization for anyone 18+. Very firm on “your body your choice”. No issues whatsoever, excellent friendly staff. I was given a choice of hospitals for the procedure, LDS and otherwise, for better insurance coverage. Booked surgery during first visit, needed ultrasound and signed acknowledgement I understood permanence. Surgery completed, billed out about $20k, after insurance total out of pocket cost about $1k. Doc also removed keloid scarring from prev surgery and endometriosis found during procedure at no cost.

[Dr. Caleb Hopwood, M.D., OB/GYN - Sugar House Health Center]
(https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u6001532) Bilateral Salpingectomy on 24yo. I asked for the bisalp specifically and he said he preferred it over a tubal. He was very understanding and repectful and never questioned my reasoning. Surgery scheduled a little over a month from consult. 

+1 Dr. Hopwood, Bisalp on 31F, Nov 2022. Everything was easy. I was approved immediately as a brand new patient with zero pushback. It was a 15 min visit with just a discussion of it being permanent and having to talk statistics, but basically I went in and said, "I want to be sterilized" and Dr Hopwood said, "great we'll get it scheduled whenever you want". I can't say enough good things about Dr. Hopwood and the entire team that took care of me.

[Dr. Robin G. Mainwaring - Granger Medical - GYN - Hysterectomy] (https://www.grangermedical.com/providers/robin-g-mainwaring-md/) Hysterectomy on 27yo (married, no kids). Originally asked about a bisalp, but Dr. Mainwaring brought up a hysterectomy as an option once she saw my age and body type. Surgery was 1 month after my consult appointment, first time meeting her. I was very upfront with my decision and reasoning, and she didn't question it once.

-1 Dr Mainwaring, one of her receptionists is anti-childfree and will tell people ‘we don’t do that here.’ NB we have recently had a member reach out to advise that Dr Mainwaring is definitely childfree friendly and is taking steps to ensure her staff do not turn away childfree people seeking permanent contraception.  

+1 Dr Mainwaring, I reached out to her and scheduled an appointment without any issue in June 2021 at 26 years old. The receptionist asked what I wanted the appointment for and I said "to discuss women's sterilization procedures." I was able to get an appointment within 3 weeks. In my appointment, I told her I'd like to be sterilized and referenced getting my tubes tied. 

[Dr. Michael Mangelson - Intermountain Health Care - Urology](http://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/medicalgroup/clinics/physicianclinics/uinstitute/locations/Pages/home.aspx?Clinic=20098) (Vasectomy) Scheduled the surgery, no questions asked.

[Dr. Andrea Smith - SL Regional Medical Center - OB/GYN](https://providers.steward.org/s/affiliation/a0d5Y00001WR0QaQAL/andrea-smith-82-s-1100-e-ste-305-salt-lake-city-ut-84102-rocky-mountain-womens) - (Tubal at 35) Never questioned my resolve.

[Dr. Susan Horvath - Millcreek Women's Center, St. Mark's Hospital - Ob/Gyn] (https://www.millcreekwomenscenter.net/susan-t-horvath-m-d-millcreek-women-s-center-doctor) Performed my partial hysterectomy when I was 28. Also discussed the idea of endometrial ablasion with her during the first appointment.

[Dr. Camille Collett, M.D. - St. Mark's Hospital and Planned Parenthood West Valley City - Family Practice - Vasectomy](http://stmarkshospital.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Camille-Collett-MD) Asked me and my partner (mid twenties) if we had/wanted children and was fine when we said no to both.

[Dr. Jennifer Kinghorn - Millcreek Women's Center](http://millcreekwomenscenter.net/). St. Mark's Women's Pavilion, 1140 East 3900 South, Suite 410, Salt Lake City, Utah 84124 Telephone: 801-262-8666. Essure implants.

Listened to his patient respectfully and was nonjudgemental and respectful, asked the routine required questions of "making sure this is the procedure I wanted to have". Did not perform the procedure himself, but provided a surgery date to be performed by an available urologist within 1 month of the consult.  

[Dr. Brandon L. Reynolds, D.O., OB.GYN](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0755702&name=brandon-l-reynolds) 5126 West Daybreak Parkway, South Jordan, UT  84009 (and other locations). 801-213-4500 Performing a salpingectomy on a 21 year old woman. 

+1 Dr Reynolds, I’m F32, no kids. No bingos, “it’s your body, it’s your choice,” mentioned seeing a lot of childfree patients seeking bisalp for permanent BC since the Dobbs decision. Provided the required info for informed consent but no attempts to change my mind. 10/10 would recommend.
  
[Dr. Kevin Jensen OBGYN] (https://stmarkshospital.com/physicians/profile/Kevin-S-Jensen-MD?utm_campaign=corp_listings_mgmt&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=business_listing&amp;utm_content=MountainPHYS_133) 801-268-6811 Salpingectomy on 33 year old female.

[Dr. Melanie Harker OBGYN - University of Utah Hospital](https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0218253) Performed bilateral salpingectomy on 27 year old female who is not married and has no kids. Listened respectfully, not condescending, no bingoes.

+1 Dr Harker, completed a full bilateral salpingectomy on 29 year old single woman with no kids. Took a bit to get the consultation as she was pretty booked at the time. Does take BCBS insurance. No bingoes. Consultation was straight forward, her staff friendly and inviting.

[Dr. Erica Faircloth]( http://www.oldfarmobgyn.com/). I am 23F single & no kids- during consultation she asked if I had considered other long-term birth control methods (IUD, implant, etc.) but ultimately she was 100% down to schedule the bi-salp as long as I didn't have any doubt about my decision. My insurance didn't cover a bi-salp, so she worked with me and removed most of the tubes and cauterized them so it could still be billed as a tubal ligation. No bingos, just wanted to make sure I was informed about options available. Told me to call her office if my insurance tried to give me any trouble. Great experience.

[Shannon L. Tilly, MD](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/find-a-doctor/t/tilly-shannon-l/) Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 32f, married, Childfree (Husband has a vasectomy) Visited this professional for years for IUDs and other forms of birth control. I asked for a bisalp, same week was contacted for scheduling for surgery within a month. Absolutely no bingos, no push back, just a professional helping solve a problem. It is unclear yet whether this doctor will go straight to sterilisation for a new patient. 

[Dr. Bryant Brown, MD](http://www.oldfarmobgyn.com/). Tubal Ligation (with cauterization). 26, unmarried. Dr. Brown was wonderful the entire process, just asked me a few questions about if I was sure if this was the choice for me. Told me that "he doesn't necessarily like to perform tubal ligations on women my age but also doesn't feel like it's his choice to make." Be prepared for bingoes with this doctor and likely won't be supportive for under 25's. 

**Lehi**

Dr. Robert Aagard of [Valley OBGYN](http://valleyobgynutah.com/portfolio/robert-o-aagard-md/). 3000 North Triumph Blvd., Suite 210 Lehi, Utah 84043. 801.756.9635. I had a bilateral salpingectomy on April 17th. He also works in American Fork and Provo. He was amazing, asked me if I knew it was permanent once and then was on board with whatever type of sterilization I wanted - happy to do it, super supportive! **Another user: I also saw Dr. Aagard for my bilateral salpingectomy (25F). He was completely willing to do the surgery from the moment he walked in the door. Fantastic experience from consultation to post-op. I saw him at the Valley office in American Fork; he does work at multiple locations.

**Spanish Fork**

[Dr. T.J. Morris of Utah Urology LLC (Vasectomy Pro)] -415 N Main St, Spanish Fork, Utah, 84660, (801) 609-4476- Got a vasectomy at 21 with no resistance. After giving him firm reasons to justify my decision, he agreed he would do it. Excellent procedure, quick recovery, and a very nice man. We actually had a conversation during the procedure itself. 

+1 Dr TJ Morris, I was able to get a vasectomy. I'm 20, single with no kids. His only requirements for men under 35 or less than 3 kids is to have a separate consultation appointment and wait 1 week after the consultation to have your procedure done

**Sandy** 

[Russell Smith, MD Alta View Hospital Women’s Center](http://www.drsmithjones.com) 9600 South 1300 East, Suite #230, Building #4 Sandy, Utah 84094. Tubal Ligation. 31, married, no kids. Dr. Smith scheduled me for sterilization within 2 minutes of discussing it and meeting him for the first time. Mentioned if I was 21 he might ask more questions, but at 30, "your body, your choice." Never asked about my husband's opinion. Asked minimal questions, answered my questions eagerly, listed relevant information (risks, what to expect). Willing to do salpingectomy and ablations. Also, this office gives nice drugs for IUDs to make the process as painless as possible "We just think, the experience is better when it's less painful." Entire process was respectful, easy, quick, and pleasant. Insurance: Select Health. Cost: 0$

**Springville**

Dr. Jeff Nance of Valley OBGYN, 801-489-0111, 672 W 400 S #100 Springville, UT. Dr. Nance was extremely kind and respectful., I couldn't have hoped for a better experience. He asked a few standard questions with no hint of judgment and went on to vocalize his full support of my choice. When discussing options for permanent sterilization, he recommended a salpingectomy over a tubal ligation, stating,"I wouldn't want the small risk of pregnancy in the back of your mind, preventing you from fully enjoying your sexual experiences. So, I recommend a salpingectomy to give you the peace of mind that will allow you your full sexual freedom." When I complimented him on his support in comparison to the horror stories I've heard, he said he only ever questions people further when they use the term "I think I want" in reference to sterilization.

**West Valley City** 

[Dr Gayle Stewart](http://www.rockymountainwomenshealthcenter.com/providers/gayle-marie-stewart-md/). She’s been my GYN for over a decade. She doesn’t do the surgeries any more but set it all up. Actual doctor who did the surgery was Dr Lindsay Lawrence. Procedure: bilateral salpingectomy (laparoscopic) My age: 32 Marital status: single Child-free. Did ask about if I was sure, what if I meet someone who really wants kids, etc. but I felt like all of her questions were just normal discussion about what it would entail and to ensure I HAD thought it through, since it was just after Roe v Wade got overturned and we had never discussed permanent birth control before. Once she realized I had thought it through and was serious, she walked me through all my options and I had the surgery a month later (no follow up appointments needed; waiting time was just based on when I could get in).

###VERMONT

**Brattleboro**

[Dr. Ellen Garvey - Brattleboro Ob/Gyn](http://www.bmhvt.org/staff/ellen-garvey), (802) 251-9965—salpingectomy at 27. Usual method of sterilization is tubal ligation with Filshie clips, but I was counseled on various options. Prudent, thoughtful, nonjudgemental. 

**Burlington** 

Dr. Lauren MacAFee at the UVM medical center in Burlington, Vermont. I don’t have any preexisting conditions that would lead to this being “medically necessary.” Rather, it’s entirely just personal preference and choice. Super helpful/communicative and also generally a warm/kind person. Would recommend her to everyone. She’s known around here specifically for being willing to sterilize younger patients. I was recommended to her by my usual gyno with this testimony. :)

[Dr. Jane Connelly, Dr. Jessica Sisto, Dr. Julie Thompson and Dr. Kym Boyman](http://vtgyn.com/). 1775 Williston Road | Suite 110 | South Burlington, VT 05403 Toll-free (877) MYVTGYN (698-8496) Bilateral salpingectomy.

Doctor Alexandra C Fenton, as well as her general office as pro sterilization. Doctor Fenton performed a full bilateral salpingectomy on me, 24yo, at the UVM hospital in burlington, vermont (full address is main campus, main pavillion, 111 colchester ave, in burlington vermont, 05401). Dr fenton and her entire team in womans health fully believed me and in my choice and offered to schedule the surgery asap. i waited maybe a month for the first appointment, and another 3.5/4 months for the procedure. they also offered to do a papsmear/nexplanon removal and exam while under anesthesia.

Dr. Maria Carracino -- Champlain Og/Gyn http://www.champlainobgyn.com/ (802) 879-1802 -- Will soon be getting a tubal at 27! Dr. Caraccino was very accepting of cf choices; she educated me in various long-term and permanent bc methods; and ultimately fully supported my decision to take the path of a tubal.

Tubal ligation, IUDs, Essure, etc. Very professional, open-minded and helpful staff. 

**Middlebury** 

Dr. Anna Benvenuto is very pro reproductive freedom. I had recently moved to the area and at my first appointment she approved me for a bisalp and got my scheduled before I left. No questions, no referrals, didn't even contact my previous doctor. She said I knew myself best and that was that. Bisalp was completed within a month.

**Rutland** 

[Ananda KN Boyer, MD](https://www.rrmc.org/doctors/profile/boyer-ananda/), Bilateral Salpingectomy, I’m 30 years old, never married and no children (The doctor who referred me stated that this hospital will do the procedure for 21+). I had a great experience with Ananda, she was extremely informative, she asked me basic questions of the the why and was non-judgmental. She went over the procedure with me during multiple appointments and I felt very comfortable. On the day of my procedure all of the nurses that set me up were extremely friendly and welcoming. My first appointment with her was mid-July of this year and the procedure was done mid-September. 

###VIRGINIA

**Alexandria** 

[Dr. Amanda Paternostro, Physicians & Midwives ObGyn located in Northern Virginia (several offices)](https://physiciansandmidwives.com/provider/amanda-paternostro/).  Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. I’m 26f, married (26m partner), childfree and no previous pregnancies. Made 1st appt in Jan this year online w/ a note that I was seeking sterilization & at my 1st visit I was very direct that I wanted my tubes tied. Dr. P didn’t hesitate and I faced 0 bingos, she just explained the procedure (only performs bilat salp, no ligation). The only q related to my husband was her making sure I wasn’t being coerced (didn’t seem to matter if I was single, wanted to make sure I was safe). Said I could schedule as quickly as I wanted. Was going to wait till fall, but after Roe leak made appt in May to reconfirm she would still do it. She totally understood the concern, appt was validating and I was scheduled <4 weeks. Currently recovering on my couch. Covered by insurance (private, BCBS), outpatient procedure, extremely validating experience throughout - Dr. P also treated endometriosis I didn’t know I had at the same time.

+1 for Dr. Amanda Paternostro. I am 23F. First appt with another doctor (Dr. Anne Kisthardt - also fantastic!) where she wanted to let me know my options for my needs and told me Dr. Paternostro herself would have to meet with me because she does all the surgeries. In one meeting with Dr. Paternostro, I word-vomited every talking point I could think of to convince her I needed a total hysterectomy. Once I was done, she said she agrees with the decision based on what I’m looking for. She only asked if I have a partner and that was it. Said they have to inform everyone there is sometimes regret with young women, but they only see it in those that decide to have a hysterectomy after having children - no bingo at all. Said she wanted to get one more pap smear and old records transferred and would have the surgical coordinator call ASAP to schedule. As long as they have openings around the time they expect, I will be uterus-free within 4 months of my first appointment!

[Drs. Kathleen Bell and Kristin Wexler](https://physiciansandmidwives.com) from Physicians and Midwives Collaborative Practice in Alexandria Virginia. Procedure bilateral salpingectomy Age 40, married, childfree The practice is a group of providers and you can look around until you find one that works with you. No bingos for listed providers. Procedure was at INOVA hospital down the street. Wait time as of Fall 2022 is 6 months. Hospital calculates insurance prior; mine was 10k without, paid 1.4k after insurance.

**Arlington**

[Dr. Sali Jordan, MD, MS ]( https://www.vhcphysiciangroup.com/doctors/sali-jordan/)700 S. Washington St., Suite 300, Alexandria, VA 22314, 703.940.3364. Body-positive doctor did bisalp on fat 23-year-old redditor. She was very kind and compassionate. She did ask me several times whether I was sure about this (mostly because I’m only 23) but she was willing to do the surgery. Because of my weight, she had another surgeon assisting (Dr. Elizabeth Brunn) who I met the day of surgery. All the doctors and nurses were mindful about my weight and mentioned that the surgery was higher risk because of my BMI, but still overall low risk, and there was never the suggestion that I should lose weight first.

Dr. Colleen Borelli [Northern Virginia Physicians to Women] (https://nvpwomen.com/) This practice has several doctors, but I only worked with Dr. Borelli. Had been a patient for several years at this point, so when she asked the questions she already knew the answers (I never wanted kids) so the approval process was fairly smooth. Procedure went very well. (27/f/bilateral salpingectomy/no pregnancies no kids)

+1 Dr Borelli - I (27F, no kids and unmarried) had a bilateral salpingectomy it's Dr. Borelli this past week. I spoke to her for the first time 2 weeks before surgery at an annual check up and she approved me on the spot. All she said was that she was obligated to inform me the procedure is permanent and irreversible. I had some issues with my insurance but was able to get those sorted with the office. There was no waiting period except to find an open surgery spot. Her office and staff were all very helpful in providing billing codes to ensure my procedure was covered in addition to sending information on cost if I was unable to get it covered by insurance.

+1 Dr Borelli - Yesterday, she did my bisalp. I went in to see her and explained why I did not want kids. She listened, asked me once if my partner knew, then approved me. She isn't the most outgoing doctor but did do the procedure on me with almost no question my motives or decision. I'm 28 with no children.

+1 Dr Borelli, bilateral salpingectomy (32F, single, no pregnancies/kids). She approved the procedure with very minimal questions asked (other than asking if I understand that it's permanent - standard stuff, no bingos). Billing staff was extremely responsive and helpful in helping me sort out codes for my insurance (Cigna - bisalp itself was 100% covered but I'm paying around $300 out of pocket for hospital fees/auxillary costs). Procedure itself went very smoothly - Dr. Borelli and the staff at Virginia Hospital Center were wonderful.

Dr. Amanda Rohn and she is an OBGYN at the [Arlington Women’s Center practice] (https://www.vhcphysiciangroup.com/doctors/amanda-e-rohn/) at Virginia Hospital Center.

[Dr. Jessica Sommer](https://www.vhcphysiciangroup.com/) with the Virginia Hospital Center Physician Group. Dr. Sommer performed a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on me (28F, unmarried, no children) a little more than a day ago. She was wonderful throughout the entire process. 

[Dr. Alexis Light](https://www.vhcphysiciangroup.com/doctors/alexis-light/). Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 26F, unmarried but partnered, childfree. Went into my first gyn appointment with Dr. Light with the intention of requesting sterilization. I was never dissuaded from the start; in fact, she gave me the option of scheduling the surgery for a month later - that was a little soon for me so I chose two months out instead. Wait time the day of was short, and the procedure went swimmingly. I highly suggest Dr. Light for other northern Virginia residents. VHC takes my insurance so my estimate is about 2k, but still I'm awaiting the charges.

**Blacksburg**

Dr Campbell - 540-605-7566 - Performs abortions ( I believe) and tubal ligations via salpingectomy - sterilized a 22 yo f with few questions. NB will NOT do bilateral salpingectomy, only clamps, and will bingo you. 

Drs. Hilary Neves and John Colby (both work for same practice). I originally called to see Dr. Colby but he had a huge influx of patients after Roe v Wade was overturned and wasn't accepting new patients, so I saw Dr. Neves instead. She sterilized me (28F at the time, childfree) with a bisalp and was very supportive of my decision.

**Chantilly** 

[Dr. Laura Kiszkiel, Capital Women's Care](https://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/172) Practice locations in: Chantilly, VA; Fairfax, VA; Springfield, VA. bilateral salpingectomy completed (32/Partnered/childfree). This doctor explicitly conveys she is of the thought camp that allows patient choice over bodily autonomy - very welcoming and trusting of patient's decision. Informed me that my insurance (Cigna Open Access) fully covers it under the ACA.

**Charlottesville** 

[Jennifer Doorey, M.D.](https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/profile/jennifer-a-doorey). Dr Doorey is moving to Baltimore MD in Feb 2023. Bilateral Salpingectomy. 20F, single, never married, no kids. Dr. Doorey was honestly a really cool doctor, she wanted me to understand the risks of such a procedure in a medical sense rather than an 'are you sure' sense. I should mention I also came prepared with an 18-page sterilization binder, which gave her the impression I was not going to waver. A few of the nurses gave me side glances, but Dr. Doorey herself was really understanding. She made sure to mention that as a doctor one of her jobs is empowering her patients (especially women) to make the best decisions for themselves.

[Dr. Carrie Sopata. OBGYN] (https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/profile/carrie-e-sopata), I’m 25F with no children, never been pregnant, and never married. She was super friendly and never bingoed me, I prepared a sterilization binder but never needed to show it to her. I do have a not-so-fun genetic condition that would make any non-IVF offspring at high risk of getting it, and have a long history of trying different birth controls for dysmenorrhea, both of which could have made her more likely to grant me the sterilization, but she was more focused on ensuring that I knew the medical risks of the procedure, and also put in an IUD for my periods. Had a great surgery team and experience overall!

+1 Dr Sopata Oct 2022. Doctor is LGBTQ+ friendly and specializes in trans health.  Bisalp on 25-year-old.

+1 Dr. Carrie Sopata, salpingectomy, 33/f, married, childfree. Had a brief consultation with Dr. Sopata, where she only asked what led me to my decision to be sterilized. She didn't question anything, didn't require any lengthy discussions, and said she was happy to offer the procedure. Highly recommend.

**Chesapeake**

[Dr. Lindner at Total Care for Women](http://www.totalcareforwomen.net/providers/paul-i-lindner-md) This practice has several doctors, Dr. Lindner was mine. He offered Essure and tubal with cauterization. He asked me once if I was sure and that was it before signing me up for the mandatory 30 day waiting period (thanks Virginia). He is really friendly and I had a great team for the surgery and recovery was a breeze. 28/f/no kids/no pregnancies.

+1 Dr. Lindner: Bisalp on 32-year-old CF redditor. " Dr. Paul Lindner in Chesapeake VA and his staff are a dream to work with. He barely asked me any questions. I came with all the points and counterpoints I've heard over and over and he didn't need to hear a damn thing. Oct 2022.

+1 Total Care for Women - I'd like to add Dr. Candace Geary from the same practice. I was 36/f/married/no kids/no pregnancies when I started seeing her for endometriosis. It took a couple years for me to bring up a hysterectomy after having been bingoed by my last gyno, but she was great about it. I asked her about it, she asked me if I was sure I didn't want kids and wouldn't ever want them, I told her I was sure, and she agreed to do it. The office staff is fantastic, too. I hit a roadblock when my insurance initially denied my surgery for not having previously had "uterine-saving procedures," but they took care of that quickly and were willing to put up whatever fight was necessary for me to get my surgery. Dr. Geary really listens to her patients and respects their ability to decide what's right for them. Her focus is gynecology, not obstetrics, and I think that makes a big difference.

[Dr Rebecca Khan](http://www.bayviewphysicians.com/location/monarch-womens-wellness/), OBGYN. 3802 Poplar Hill Rd, Chesapeake, VA 23321.  30/F/Bilateral Salpingectomy : She agreed to do the procedure for me after a roughly 30 minute consultation. I had never been to her practice prior to this appointment. I was informed that there were several long term, but not permanent, forms of birth control that she would be willing to discuss with me if I so choose but did not elaborate since I did not express interest. The state of Virginia requires you to sign a consent form and go through a 30 day waiting period prior to the procedure. A second appointment was set up some time during that 30 day waiting period to do lab work and preadmissions for surgery. Day of surgery went off without any major complications. 

[Dr. Craig Ruetzel](https://ruetzelobgyn.com/); (757)-410-7390; Located near Chesapeake City Park. Patient is 20/F. Performs bilateral tubal ligation via bipolar cauterization in multiple parts of the fallopian tube. Truly a wonderful doctor who does not want his patients to suffer. He agreed to my surgery with the mindset of "the decision is yours, a doctor's job is only to give you information to make an informed decision", but I came prepared and firm in my decision. He even agreed to look further into my other gynecological issues, so chances are I will keep him as my normal doctor if the surgery goes smoothly. You might, too!

+1 Dr. Ruetzel. March 2023. Bisalp on 26-year-old redditor. At my appointment, he came in the room he just said, “So, you want to get sterilized. Do you have any questions for me?” And I just said “Well first off, are you willing to do it?” And he immediately said “Oh yeah, I don’t see any reason not to.“ I instinctively started stating reasons I want to be sterilized and he just said "You don't need to explain yourself to me." We actually spent most of the appointment talking about the issues of paternalism in medicine and he even said that from what he's not interested in acting like he's my father and making my decision for me. If I decide I want to be sterilized and later regret it, that's my decision to make. He even said that in his experience, childfree people tend to put more thought into the idea of parenthood than actual parents. He's very easy to talk to, really funny and overall he just gets it.

+1 Dr Ruetzel, married 33y/o female child free Initial appointment was Feb 2023. Bilateral salpingectomy and uterine ablation. The doctor said yes and we discussed 20+ minutes about sexism in healthcare and good local pizza. The 30 day waiting period paper work was filled out this day. For insurance pre-approval patient had to go through ultrasound and a uterine biopsy, but surgery was scheduled for May 2023. The doctor is aware of his presence on the child free Reddit via his daughters. Doctor Rutezel is absolutely amazing and patient (me) will be returning to him as my primary obgyn until he retires which will hopefully be many years from now.

[Doctors Jeanne Busch and Linda Long at Gynecology Specialists](https://gynspecialistschesapeake.com/) in Chesapeake, Va. Dr. Long is my usual gynecologist, but she no longer performs surgeries, so referred me to Dr. Busch. A bisalpingectomy performed laproscopically. I am 30yo, married, and child-free. Dr. Long has known (and supported) my child-free status for years, and at each appt would ask me if I still was, and if I wanted to proceed with surgery. As soon as I said I was ready, she did her due diligence of suggesting other birth control methods/asking if my husband would get a vasectomy. She then scheduled me an appt with her colleague Dr. Busch. Dr. Busch also did her due diligence, including asking why I wanted the surgery. She did not bingo me, just confirmed that I knew my options and the risks. I was placed on the 30-day waiting period and had my surgery date a month later due to the surgical wait list. She also asked and got the hospital to agree to let me take home my tubes so I can keep them in a jar!

**Christiansburg**

[Dr. Christopher Reynolds, Carilion Clinic Urology](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/christopher-r-reynolds-md) - Vasectomy for 22M, approved on first try. He was very gracious and understanding.

**Culpeper**

[Dr. Matthew Kucia, MD](https://www.novanthealthuva.org/find-a-doctor/npi/1477935096/matthew-r-kucia.aspx) Novant Health UVA Health System, Medical Center, 501 Sunset Ln, Culpeper, VA 22701 Phone: (540) 321-3002    33/F/Married/No Kids/Bilateral Salpingectomy : 
We had a 30 minute consult (first meeting) where I was asked why I wanted sterilization. We discussed other BC options and vasectomy (due to shorter recovery time) but I stated I wanted piece of mind and no hormones. He stated that he only removes tubes, does not tie or clip. He then asked when I would like it done since my IUD had 1 year left. I said ASAP and he scheduled the appointment for 10 days later. Surgery happened with no issues and I did have to sign a consent form that I understood it was a permanent procedure that would make it impossible to have children. At the 6 week post-surgery checkup, he showed me before and after interior pictures from surgery. He was very friendly and seems extremely passionate about his job/work.

NB "Dr Kucia refused hysterectomy citing lack of medical need, despite my desire to never have periods again and be sterilized, as well as having approval from my primary doctor. Said insurance would not cover and he could not think of an appropriate billing. Perfectly willing to do IUD and bisalp."

Dr Iris Amarante - mentioned that she'd potentially be willing to provide a bisalp on women as young as 21 who were sure about being childfree. 

**Fairfax**

[Dr Paulina Wilson](https://www.inova.org/doctors/paulina-g-wilson-md) 8081 Innovation Park Dr #500, Fairfax, Virginia, 22031, (571)472-7040. My vasectomy consult was about ten minutes, she asked me if I had thought long about my decision and was sure. I said yes and I was. She agreed to the procedure and scheduled it asap. She was very thorough explaining the procedure and aftercare. At the time I was twenty years old and engaged. Currently twenty-one, single, and fully childfree.

[Dr. Matthew Moynihan](https://www.inova.org/doctors/matthew-j-moynihan-md) INOVA Fairfax hospital, 8081 Innovation Park Dr 500, Fairfax, VA 22031, 571-472-7040. Vasectomy on 26-year-old redditor. Doctor gave me nothing but non-judgmental support. Couldn't have been a better experience.

[Dr. Margaret Strickland](https://www.inova.org/doctors/margaret-h-strickland-md) at INOVA Fairfax hospital in Fairfax, Virginia. I am 24 years old cis female, currently single and not currently sexually active, and have never been married or pregnant. I am childfree and will never want children of any kind in any way. I had an excellent experience with Dr. Strickland. In brief, she did not question my decision at all and even said something to the effect that she believes in bodily autonomy and that having/raising children is not for everyone. Dr. Strickland was incredibly supportive and respectful of my decision to be sterilized. She made me feel very comfortable and was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process.

**Falls Church** 

Dr. Michael Lempel at Invoa (Falls Church VA) has agreed to do my bislap with no pushback. I'm 28F, and heard about him from a friend who got a Bislap at age 26. Still waiting to hear from his scheduler, but Dr. Lempel has a great bedside manner, I didn't need a binder, and he was very thorough. All I had to do was mention that I'd been interested in sterilization since I was 21, and he literally said 'This is the point where we're supposed to go over other options, but I don't feel the need to do that, do you?'

**Gainesville** 

[Ayatllah Khafagy - Stone Springs OBGYN](https://hcavirginia.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Ayatallah-M-Khafagy-MD). Bilateral Salpingectomy (also performs tubal ligation). 33/Married/CF. Brought up sterilization up at my recent annual exam with my NP, and that day she scheduled a consult with Dr. Khafagy for the following week. Both providers were extremely supportive, no questions asked, both offered the IUD as an option too but I declined with zero pushback. The procedure was scheduled and performed for about a month after my consultation. Fully covered by my insurance (CareFirst Blue Choice) and everything went extremely smoothly! All of the nurse and staff at Stone Springs Hospital were extremely kind and helped sooth all my anxieties.

**Harrisonburg**

Dr. Jennifer Visger at Shenandoah Women's Healthcare (swhc-office.com). Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24 y/o, unmarried/no partner, no kids. Of note: Very kind and supportive. I was admittedly an already established patient and I have hypermobility/eds which could possibly have factored into how few questions she had about how sure I was about getting sterilized.

**Leesburg**

[Dr. Nadim Hawa](https://www.cwcashburn.com/) Performed a total hysterectomy + bilateral salpingectomy. I requested this after two ultrasounds showing potential fibroids/adenomyosis, rather than going through with more invasive screening, because I'd wanted one forever. He was very supportive. For context, I was 29, living with my partner (not married), and never wanted kids. I'll say I had very good insurance at the time (BCBS) and ended up paying $40 out of pocket (copays for surgeon + anesthesiologist). Surgery was laparoscopic and the whole procedure was very easy and comfortable. Quick recovery (was feeling pretty good after about 3 weeks, normal after about 4 weeks). No bingos! NB: members who wish to consult with Dr Hawa need to specifically book in with him as his partner, Dr. Tyan, will require psychological clearance before considering sterilisation. 

+1 Dr Hawa,  I am 24, childfree, and married. The consult appointment was quick and easy. I asked for a bilateral salpingectomy with endometrial ablation because I was worried that I'd be denied asking for anything more. He said he'd be willing to do that, but recommended a partial hysterectomy instead since I likely have endometriosis and want that addressed as well. They're calling to set up an appointment for their first available opening. "Dr. Hawa and his clinic is centered around treating women with respect and encouraging their rights. After getting bingo-d by six doctors, I wrote an essay and got five references to prove I understood the consequences of surgery. When I gave them to him he was appalled and said that I never should have had to go through that, then apologized for the doctors who failed me. Asked for bisalp and ablation, he suggested partial hysterectomy instead. "If I can make my own reproductive choices as a man, you should have those same rights as a woman" Covered under Anthem/BCBS.

[Dr. Jacob and Dr. Brown at Capital Women's Care](https://cwcloudoun.com/), I am 36 (35 at the time of the procedure), single, childfree now sterilized. I had a myomectomy (fibroid removal), endometrial ablation, and a tubal ligation. Dr. Jacob is my main gynecologist and never bingoed me when I first brought up sterilization and my desire to never have children. She understood and said having children isn't for everyone. I was referred to Dr. Brown since she's the surgeon and she also never questioned my request for the tubal in addition to the ablation. They take most insurances (I have Cigna) and operate out of the Inova hospital system. Inova actually just dismissed the $1500 I owed after insurance from the surgery.

**Lynchburg** 

[Dr. Matthew Tompkins, Lynchburg Gynecology](https://lynchburggynecology.com/providers/matthew-tompkins-md/) - 26, unmarried, childfree, bilateral salpingectomy. I had been a patient of Dr. Tompkins for 1.5 years and on birth control. I decided I wanted to come off of birth control and asked Dr. Tompkins about sterilization. He asked if I was sure I didn’t want children, and when I said yes, he said okay here are the options and explained a tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy. I am on Medicaid, so I had to sign a form for insurance, wait 30 days, and come back and confirm I still wanted the procedure. I signed the forms, confirmed in 30 days, and had my surgery. My surgery was also 100% covered under Medicaid in Virginia.

+1 Dr. Tompkins of Lynchburg Gynecology, Virginia, 26/female/never married/never pregnant: I found Dr. Tompkins through this subreddit, but was unsure of approval because I was a new patient from over 1.5 hours away. Upon arrival, he was very respectful, gracious, and understanding. Told me that "If I'm old enough to have a child, I'm old enough to choose not to." I had a surgery date about a month after my first consult: successful bisalp that took under two hours from knockout to recovery. Approx. $1,700 after all costs with Blue Anthem/Blue Shield insurance. A sweet, soft-spoken, and wonderful doctor who I'd recommend to anyone needing a quick and easy sterilisation in the VA area. 10/10.

[Dr. Graham Nelsen](https://www.womenshealthofcentralvirginia.com/graham-nelsen-md/) Procedure - BiSalp, laparoscopy Info- 27, married, never pregnant & childfree Experience - No bingos, but suggested my husband get sterilized instead for obvious reasons. Simple/reasonable questions, and approved me with just a few of my main concerns having been listed. Quickly scheduled procedure with the surgery center. Morning of, all the staff were kind. Time passed super quick honestly, and next thing I know Dr. Nelsen is walking in and doing the final “This is permanent, no going back.” I just said, “That’s the plan!”. Post-op I was taken back to my room where I had a quick discharge as I felt no pain other than some tenderness at the bellybutton incision site. I was wheeled out to the car and on my way home! Dr. Nelsen is friendly and I do recommend him for anyone who is capable of gestation and seeking sterilization. He seems committed to supporting autonomy.

**Manassas**

[Dr Victor Khayat](https://www.nhlakemanassasobgyn.org/our-providers/npi/1750329454/victor-r-khayat.aspx). He completed a bilateral Salpingectomy for me and was willing to set it up at my very first appt. I’m a 24 year old unmarried woman with no children. I did not receive any bingos at the regular office where he practices or from Dr Khayat himself. He did counsel on risk of regret as required. However there was a few confused glances from hospital staff the day of the procedure. He was booked out about a month when I scheduled my procedure.

Had the state-required conversations and she OKed the surgery immediately. Have to wait 30 days in VA to get call from surgical scheduler. $2000 w/ Aetna insurance. No bingos whatsoever; completely understanding and welcoming.

+1 Dr Lavery, accepted my [23F, unwed, childless] request for sterilization and completed a bisalp with care ~2 mo. after initial consult. The cost with Blue Cross Blue Shield was $2,544. No judgement from her at all!

Nazaneen Homaifar, INOVA OB/GYN McLean VA. I'm a 34 year old cis woman, unmarried, no children. Asked Dr. Homaifar about sterilization at our first visit. She asked a few questions and said yes immediately. I was really shocked- I've been told no many times before. The surgery was easy to schedule. I got no pushback from her or her team. I had my bilateral salpingectomy yesterday and all went well.

[Dr. Giulia Dulá](https://virginiawomenscenter.com/) 7515 Right Flank Road, Mechanicsville, Virginia 23116 (804) 288-4084. Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy, 31, married, no children. Could have had the surgery in July after the consult in May - chose to have it in August. I have seen Dr. Dula as my gyno for years. Still, I was prepared with my list of reasons. She stopped me and said “you’re a grown women who can make her own decisions. I will sterilize anyone who wants that.” I told her in passing that my husband is on board, too. She told me it wouldn’t have mattered if he wasn’t. “Your body, your choice.” I have 100% trust in Dr. Dula.

**Midlothian** 

[Dr. Kristen Lewis](https://vpfw.com/provider/kristen-lewis/) at Virginia Physicians for Women in Midlothian, VA, she also sees patients at the Prince George location. Performed a bilateral salpingectomy on single 24F with no kids. Went over the risks of surgery, alternative birth control methods, and required discussion of regret rates, and then approved me with no issues whatsoever. The entire experience was great too, no bingos from any of the other staff and the surgery was quick. Awesome experience, she was very kind and understanding!

**Norfolk** 

[Alissa Thieke](https://www.evms.edu/patient_care/specialties/obstetrics_and_gynecology/physicians_and_providers/general_obstetrics__gynecology/name_204475_en.php) and the doctor who sent me to her was [Thomas Kimble](https://www.evms.edu/patient_care/specialties/obstetrics_and_gynecology/physicians_and_providers/general_obstetrics__gynecology/name_6435_en.php). They’re both with Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) in Norfolk, Virginia.  They were both wonderful and very supportive. Dr. Kimble went over all the other options available to prevent pregnancy (IUD, etc) but in a “just so you know all your options” way, not a bingo way. As soon as I said I wanted a bisalp he said “great, let’s make it happen!”  Dr. Thieke was also supportive, no bingos or signs of reluctance to do the procedure on her end.

Dr. Angela Parson Obstetrician-gynecologist, I recently had a bisalp about two weeks ago. I just got back from a checkup with my gyno. She was also the one who performed my surgery and approved it. I've been seeing her for years and she's been nothing but amazing and understanding. I asked her if she was comfortable being added to the list we have on this subreddit and she had no issues with it. Womancare Centers, PLC 100 Kingsley Ln #200, Norfolk, VA 23505

**Norfolk/Virginia Beach**

[Elite Women's Care: Dr. Sample, OBGYN](http://www.elitewomenscare.com); located in the Halifax building of Kempsville Circle directly across from Sentara Leigh Hospital. The office is centrally located near the Norfolk/Virginia Beach line with quick access to I-64 and I-264. She does bilateral tubal ligations and Essure (I got the former). SUPER sweet- you may even want keep her as your regular doctor! Just make sure to have a good answer when she throws the "1/3 regret it" statistic. I'm 27/F; 2 abortions with no live births (although I know she would have done it without the abortion history). PS- She did a phenomenal job with the actual surgery. 

-1 Dr. Malena Sample. Dr. agreed to do a bisalp on 26-year-old redditor, then cancelled 1 week before the scheduled surgery date because she didn't "feel comfortable" because redditor is not sexually active. When redditor brought up the possibility of rape, something that RAINN says happens to 1 in every 6 American women, the doctor was completely dismissive, saying "that’s not likely to happen”.

+1 Dr Sample. Jan 2023. Bisalp on 29-year-old redditor without pushback.

[Dr. Elizabeth Baker Golpira](https://womancarecenters.com/contact/). She did a bilateral salpingectomy for me. 29f. No kids. I only had to wait 30 days from my initial appointment to scheduling the surgery.

-1 Dr Golpira refused sterilisation for a 33 year old who was "forced to wait three months on hormonal birth control before she would then see me again and reconsider my procedure in case I 'changed my mind'".

[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth](https://portsmouth.tricare.mil/) Performed a vasectomy on my 28-year-old husband with little to no bingo-ing. I know it's typically difficult for military folks to get 'fixed' because of the culture. My husband went in there prepared. they asked him the usual questions to make sure he knew the ramifications and required him (and all vasectomy patients) to attend a 1 hour class that explains the procedure. Once he did that, he was approved with no hassle or pushback. 

[Dr Syed Ahmed Hussain - Naval Medical Centre Portsmouth](https://www.vitadox.com/doctor/portsmouth-va-23708/syed-ahmed-hussain/qQvw2nppNWZwwdFFrH4KHd). I will do b/l salpingectomies on any women no matter if they've had children or not. I've performed multiple b/l salpingectomies on 23yr olds who have never been pregnant. I would probably do it as young as 21 but have never been approached by anyone younger than 23.

Dr. Rustin C. Walters, Urologist, NMCP. He did my vasectomy when I was age 28, married with no children. Asked the basic questions and gave me a surgery date during my initial consultation. Returned a month later and got it done with no issues.

[Urology of Virginia: Dr. John S. Liu, Urologist] (https://www.urologyofva.net/); Went in for a vasectomy as a 25-year-old single man. Had absolutely no issues. He did bring up my age, lack of children, and marital status, but also said he trusted that I had already considered the implications. He only asked for my reason why out of curiosity. Very polite. Very professional. Did a group consultation followed by a one-on-one consultation. He has a ton of experience doing the procedure and offers all options including no-scalp, cauterization, etc. Answered all of our questions thoroughly and offered a ton of helpful info regarding the procedure and the recovery process. Their office has many other urologists who can preform this type of procedure. I can't speak for the others' willingness, but I'm sure at least some wouldn't have a problem with it. I went to the location at 225 Clearfield Ave in VA Beach.  They have multiple locations in VA Beach, Suffolk, Hampton, Williamsburg, and South Boston.  Have to wait at least 30 days for the actual procedure because of weird Virginia law. Appointment scheduled for October. Will update with more info about the procedure itself once I go through with it.

**Reston**

[The Urology Group of Virginia](https://www.urologygroupvirginia.com/) I met only with Dr. Walter O’Brien but, it sounds like the rest of the practice is similar. Vasectomy at 26, no kids. He required a 10 minute consult that was 90% just going over the legal requirements, basically zero push back. The day of my procedure, there was another sub-30 with no kids getting one done by him as well.

I met with Dr. Chuck Pruna at the same practice and he performed my vasectomy. I'm 24 not married and have no kids. I had a 10 minute consult and then scheduled the surgery for a month later. The surgery took about 3 hours in total, and TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) was administered.

[Reston Women's Center](https://restonwomenscenter.com/) I was 29, and unmarried with no kids (still am). I interacted mostly with the staff and the NP who I had talked to about my IUD, and they were all lovely (the NP especially, though I can't remember her name). I had come prepared with a partial medical history (from my PCP) detailing how other birth control methods hadn't worked for me, and didn't end up needing it. Virginia requires a 2-week waiting period after you make your appointment, and the practice does surgeries every other Friday in the nearby Reston Surgical Center. Dr. Hashemi is their surgeon, if I recall correctly, and was my only speed bump in the entire process (she recoded my procedure as elective instead of preventative immediately before my surgery, and it ended up being a whole ordeal with my insurance), but I got no pushback from anyone there.

+1 Reston Women's Centre, Dr. Diana Shusterovich. Dr. Shusterovich is literally the best OBGYN and Doctor I’ve ever had. My experience with her could not have been better. She is 200000% supportive of women and whatever fertility option the patient wants for themselves. The surgery was super easy and I healed up great - I was walking around just fine that night. Incisions just felt like rug burns and only took combo of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for 2 days after. Dr. S followed up by phone the week after and followed up in person three weeks after where we basically commiserated about the state of the US lol. They took my insurance (UMR United Health) and the office was great about doing their best to figure out your est out of pocket prior to surgery. So far, I’m looking at $1,200 out of pocket but of course I won’t know for sure until I get the bill.

**Richmond**

[Dr. Courtney Legum-Wenk, DO](https://virginiawomenscenter.com/doctors/dr-courtney-legum-wenk/) She services the Richmond area through Virginia Women's Center. I'm booked for a bisalp in this month, she gave me no issue booking the procedure after my first visit with her earlier this summer before Roe being overturned. She's been great to work with, no BS with her or my BCBS insurance who cover it 100% (31/partner/CF). 

[Dr. Leigh Lewis](https://virginiawomenscenter.com/doctors/dr-leigh-b-lewis/). She works out of Virginia Women's Center and performed the procedure in Henrico Doctors Hospital. I'm 33, no children, single, got a bisalp. My request was accepted the first visit even though I'd never seen her before. She gave a very short "permanent, other options" spiel prefixed by "I'm sure you already know this." It felt like a rote requirement, not serious. We discussed ablation, but she advised against it for insurance reasons unless she found signs of endo inside. She indicated she is willing to perform it if my periods get worse off HBC. Surgery was about a month later, post-op a month after. No problems, very happy.

[Dr Lindsey Pflunger, MD, OBGYN]( https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/lindsey-pflugner) VCU Medical Center 3400 Haydenpark Lane, Henrico, VA 23233, (804) 828-4409. Bilateral salpingectomy on 24 year old single woman. Appointment was made in May 2022, and had to wait for June for the consultation. I explained all my reasons for not wanting children. She asked if I was absolutely sure and I told her yes. We went over the procedure, risks, recovery time, and wait time. No bingos, pushbacks, or any judgement. She listened to me the whole time. A week later, her surgery scheduler scheduled the surgery 30 days in advanced so insurance would cover the procedure. Extremely kind and understanding doctor, and surgeon. Her whole team was amazing.

Dr. Aaron Goldberg, 30yo cis woman, no kids, no spouse, VCU Health Ambulatory Care Center 417 N 11th St, Richmond, VA 23219 (United States). He was really helpful in answering my questions and very sympathetic about how other doctors had treated me.

[Dr Anna Baur](https://hcavirginia.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Anna-Baur-MD), Bilateral Salpingectomy 29F

Laura C. Pendlebury, MD - Virginia Women's Center Age - 29, No kids, never pregnant, Not married (doctor never inquired on my marital status, it's in my chart). Inquired on why I preferred this over IUD or other LABC (hormones and traveling mostly). Mostly does banding procedure, but can perform others. Does have a waiting period despite state restrictions being lifted, I will note the surgical schedule was also 6 weeks booked so it didn't matter anyway. Performed in Henrico Doctor's Hospital Outpatient surgical center was in and out in a few hours and quickly recovered with basically no scar. I will note that the doctor group also has offices associated with a catholic hospital. These offices cannot perform surgical sterilizations. Great doc, very professional, no bingos, just wanted to make sure I understood the risks.

[Virginia Urology] (http://www.uro.com/). Vasectomy at 24, married with no kids. I went to the Stony Point location but have no reason to suspect that others would not be cooperative. 

[Dr. Jordan Hylton](https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/find-a-provider/jordan-hylton) VCU Medical Center - Nelson Clinic and Stony Point. Offers tubal ligation (bands) and salpingectomy. Asked me (30 year old with no children) what led me to the decision and that was it. She's a very sweet doctor and I felt very comfortable with her.

[Dr. Maria Meussling Schleicher, MD, FACOG]( https://vpfw.com/provider/maria-meussling-schleicher/)  Henrico Doctors' Hospital Professional Building
7605 Forest Avenue, Suite 206, Richmond, VA 23229 and West Creek Medical Park - Short Pump
1630 Wilkes Ridge Parkway, Suite 200, Richmond, VA 23229, 804-897-2100. Bisalp on 20-year old CF woman in 2022.

+1 Dr Schleicher,  22/f/unmarried/no kids. Dr. Schleicher was incredible, one consult and we were booking surgery. No bingoing. She just asked that I verify that I understood it was permanent, asked if I had any preference on method of sterilization, helped me to get some genetic testing done for cancer risk, and did her best for me to make sure I had a good experience. Her whole team is wonderful, and the anesthesia team did an excellent job helping me through having anxiety around anesthesia. She never asked if I was married, never treated me like I shouldn't be making this choice, just treated me with the utmost respect. Highly recommend.

**Roanoke**

[Dr. Whisnant - Urology Associates](https://carilionclinic.org/locations/urology-associates-ltd) Vasectomy at 26, single no kids. Earliest consultation appointment was a month out, talked for maybe five to ten minutes, no pushback in and out of the office under 30 minutes. Traditional scalpel procedure a month later, took 15 minutes, in and out in under 30 again.

[Dr. Jessica Sosa Stanley](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/jessica-n-sosa-stanley-md?utm_campaign=website-link&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=local-listing). I had a bilateral salpingectomy with her, I'm 30 and unmarried. I had to wait 6 weeks for my consult appointment, we had a short chat about my child-free lifestyle, she said I was a perfect candidate for the surgery, and booked my surgery for 4 weeks later! She was the surgeon and was incredible. I highly recommend her!

+1 Dr Sosa Stanley, she did my consult in 5 minutes and had me scheduled very quickly. At the moment though, she is on maternity leave, I have no clue when she will come back to her practice. But she is still a very good doctor to keep on this list!

Dr. Isaiah Johnson. Sterilized a friend (18F, childfree) with a bisalp and was one of the providers I was looking into for my own procedure. (NB no first hand review has been provided for this doctor yet) 

**Stafford** 

[Dr Yetunde Adenle](https://www.obgynvirginia.com/providers/yetunde-adenle-md/). Bilateral Salpingectomy. I'm 32, married, never had a child, totally childfree. I have Meritain insurance, covered 100%, only paid a co-pay. No bingos, Dr Adenle and the whole practice/hospital staff were totally supportive. About 6 weeks from request to surgery date.

[Dr Kurian Thott](https://www.obgynvirginia.com/providers/kurian-thott-md-facog/) did my bilateral salpingectomy and uterine ablation without any questions, hesitations, or bingos. I am a married, 34 y/o female, with no children. I did have to wait about a month for a surgical consult, as well as another month for the actual surgery, but that is because he is in high demand. He's a great doc all around (my usual OBGYN) and very delicate with surgery. He practices in both Stafford and Fredericksburg Virginia.

**Suffolk** 

I saw Dr. Edward Wing at Lifetime Women's Health in Suffolk, Virginia in 2021 and was able to have a tubal litigation. I was 28 at the time and childfree. I was not questioned beyond my medical history and he took all of my concerns seriously.

**Tappahannock**

Virginia Women Center - 804.288.4084. Accepts Plan First, Virginia’s FREE family planning program for men and women. (Dr. Matthew F. Vogel was my surgeon. He was very kind and nonjudgmental and so was the staff. Preformed Tubal Cauterization on a 30 year old female.)

**Virginia Beach** 

[Virginia League for Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/virginia/virginia-beach/23462/virginia-beach-health-center-4166-91750?utm_campaign=virginia-beach-health-center&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=local-listing) - Vasectomy for people over 18. Will ask if you have caused a pregnancy but will perform vasectomy regardless of answer.

**Warrenton**

[Jeffrey Bell](https://www.novanthealthuva.org/pf/providers/1336118553/jeffrey-bell/about-me). Procedure was bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 32, single, no children Copay was about $300 (I'm on Aetna Medicare). The only questions he asked were "you're aware it's permanent?" and "you're sure you don't want kids?", after I confirmed these two things, he handed me the consent form, and we scheduled it for about two months after that. (no psych screening)

**Williamsburg**

[Dr. Karanvir Virk](https://www.riversideonline.com/rmg/obgyn/williamsburg/Karanvir-Virk-profile.cfm), (757) 253-5600. Performs salpingectomies --did one for 27 year old female with no children (can perform Tubal Ligations, but suggests salpingectomies as it takes no additional time and removal of fallopian tubes reduces chances of ovarian cancer and basically eliminates the chance of an ectopic pregnancy). Excellent surgeon. Excellent facilities. Have your reasons for being fixed clear and concise.

**Winchester** 

Yekaterina Rabkin, Winchester OB-gyn, 1705 Amherst St, Winchester, VA 22601. I offer sterilization for both parents and people without children. 21 is the youngest I would offer sterilization.

###WASHINGTON

**Bellevue**

[Dr. Mary Welch](https://wa-clinician.kaiserpermanente.org/womens-health-care/42811/) @ Kaiser.  I started going to her for general women's health checkup and IUD.  Last year, I mentioned that I want a bilateral salpingectomy and she just said ok, no questions asked.  My surgery at Kaiser was a breeze, I even had an all-women surgical team.  At my checkup, she even jokingly said I can recommend her to all my childfree friends.  

[Mary Belniak](https://wa-clinician.kaiserpermanente.org/womens-health-care/73011/). I had a bilateral salpingectomy. I was 29 years old and childfree. I discussed this with her and she was very receptive while still making sure I was aware of other options. She did not try to talk me out of it at any point. Her care and followup was excellent. This was done at zero cost to me even with only having Apple Health insurance.

**Bellingham**

[Dr So](https://www.peacehealth.org/care-providers/see-yin-s-so-do) performed my total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy on October 18th. I’m 35, single, and child free. My appointment with her was in August, she listened to my reasons for wanting a hysterectomy (heavy, painful menses, family history, worried about losing access to birth control) and never tried to persuade me to not get one. In fact she said understood and would normally ask me if I needed more time to consider, but I’m light of recent political events she would schedule me right away. She was very kind and very thorough in explaining and answering any questions I had. I wish I had known her in my early twenties! 

Planned Parenthood - [Bellingham Health Center] (http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/washington/bellingham/98225/bellingham-health-center-2454-91780), sterilization for men over 18 years old. No female sterilization.

[Dr. Dina Levin at PeaceHealth] (https://www.peacehealth.org/findadoc/care-providers/5848/dina-j-levin-md) Tubal ligations for women, gave me one at age 22. Dr Levin has also given a 21 year old a hysterectomy.

Also 1990 Hospital Dr., Suite 100 Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284, 360-856-6490. Bisalp on 25-year-old redditor. Was super nice and fast. Did not give me any trouble for being younger or not having kids beforehand. Was very professional. I found it helped to be super prepared but he let me know that he's performed it on younger people than me without children as well. He was able to get me in on a cancellation and he combined my consultation and pre-op so I only had to have one appointment before the actual surgery. Sept. 2022.

[Dr. Lindsay Emerick, MD, OBGYN]( https://www.peacehealth.org/care-providers/lindsay-e-emerick-md) PeaceHealth 4465 Cordata Pkwy Suite 102, Bellingham, WA 98226, 360-752-5280. Bisalp on 22-year-old redditor. Takes most insurance including Applecare (WA state Medicaid). They also have a generous financial aid program for underinsured people or any costs related to care not covered by insurance. The only question she asked me was how long I had wanted this done. She is very informative every step of the way, and firmly believes in the patient having bodily autonomy. 

**Bonney Lake/ Enumclaw** 

Gouhar Khan, MD [CHI Franciscan Health] Has office hours in both Enumclaw and Bonney Lake. Gave me (30/f/childfree) tubal ligation  no problems. https://www.chifranciscan.org/find-a-doctor/details.physician.1617d58a-6bc1-4cb3-9d17-0969ddc93a97.html

**Edmonds** 

[Dr. Randolph Bourne, Swedish OB/GYN Specialists Edmonds](http://www.swedish.org/physicians/b/bourne-randolph-b?reviews=true) - Gave me a tubal ligation without any hassle or disapproval. Friendly and funny, will answer any questions in a way that's easy to understand without talking down to you. 

[Dr. Kristin Riley](https://www.virginiamason.org/kristin-a-riley-md) - Dr. Riley is a rad lady with a dyed pink streak in her hair.  She practices with Virginia Mason and I first saw her at the Edmonds clinic location and then had my laparascopic bilateral salpingectomy in downtown Seattle.  She asked me (I'm 31 and married) why I wanted the procedure, I told her, and she said OK all within about 60 seconds.  No hassle at all!

**Everett/Mill Creek**

[Dr. Laurent Nicolov, The Everett Clinic MD, OB/GYN] (https://www.everettclinic.com/physicians/laurent-nicolov) - Dr. Nicolov is an older fella who gave me no issues when I went in for a consultation to get a Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy and Endometrial Ablation. Told me (28F) that the choice to be a mother was mine and he was only there to give me info. Appt. was done in 20 minutes and I got my surgery scheduled within a week!

[Dr. Quan Dau](https://www.everettclinic.com/locations-nav/providers/wa/quan-dau-md/1295998490.html). I, 27, had a bilateral salpingectomy & partial hysterectomy. He specifically stated that he was not there to convince me to have children. But that he was required for liability reasons to go over alternatives and the facts.

[Dr. Michael Wong](https://www.providence.org/doctors/obstetrics-and-gynecology/wa/everett/michael-wong-1174535314) from Providence Everett, WA. He was the OBGYN/Surgeon who performed my bilateral salpingectomy. Zero bingos, no judgement, no self-defense, only relevant medical questions and very brief/basic "what made you decide to do this" stuff asked pretty much to just make sure I was completely coherent/not under the influence of anything or being forced to make a major medical decision against my will. Very gentle and easy going personality, a little humorous/funny in a light hearted way sometimes. He had to do the "I'm obligated to tell you about the chance of regret" line, but that is literally all he said before quickly moving on. I am 35, F/AFAB, in a long term hetero relationship but never married, and never been pregnant nor ever will be now.

**Federal Way**

[Dr. Marisa Dahlman MD, OBGYN] (https://www.vmfh.org/find-a-doctor/gynecology/marisa-dahlman-1144497728) Virginia Mason, 33501 First Way S., Federal Way, WA 98003, (253) 874-1604. Bilateral Salpingectomy. Dr. was entirely trusting in my decision to be child free and open to allowing me to seek sterilization at 26. Specialist in transgender health. Also in Seattle.

**Gig Harbor**

[Dr. Orestes Molina, MultiCare](https://www.multicare.org/doctors/orestes-molina/) - Tubal ligation. Asked the very basic "Are you sure?" and "You know this is permanent, right?" questions but without coercion or judgment. Just doing his job. 

**Issaquah** 

[Issaquah Obstetrics &amp;amp;amp; Gynecology](http://www.issaquahobgyn.com/home.html) had no problem performing a laparoscopy on me, a 25 year old woman. She does all surgery in-house, so there are no hospital fees. 

[Dr. Helen E Erikson, D.O, Swedish OB/GYN Specialists - Issaquah] (https://www.swedish.org/locations/swedish-ob-gyn-specialists-issaquah) Had no problem with performing a laparoscopic total hysterectomy on me, a 26 year old woman! Told me she would have agreed to do it when I was 19 if I had come into her office then. They even have the Da Vinci robot! 

+1 Dr Erikson, she was exactly as amazing as the wiki promised. No bingoes whatsoever and no reference to my partner. She did go over all the non-permanent options before talking about surgery, but did so in a slightly apologetic and "I have to give you the shpiel" manner - not at all patronizing. And after I confirmed just once that I knew I wanted a hysterectomy, she accepted that immediately and started talking about scheduling, surgery prep, what to know, and so forth.

+1 Dr Erikson, Swedish Hospital, Issaquah, Washington. I asked for a laparoscopic total hysterectomy and bisalp. She did have me try an IUD first for insurance purposes so I could get the surgery covered. She scheduled me for the surgery 3 months out from the date she put the IUD in. She was very adamant about "my body my choice" and did not try to change my mind. Just made sure I was informed. I'm 27. Female. Child free. Married.

+1 Dr Erikson. Feb 2023. My surgeon was a lovely person that gaveme  no hassle (though she did list other options for legal reasons).  My consult was in October, got the surgery in Feb 2023. 

Dr. Holly Sato, MD, FACOG Practices out of the [Swedish OB/GYN Specialists](https://schedule.swedish.org/doctors/obstetrics-and-gynecology/wa/seattle/holly-sato-1467625103). Wonderfully warm and fun personality. She approved me for sterilization with absolutely no resistance (32F, no children), very supportive of each woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions. She and the entire First Hill Surgery Center medical team assigned to my procedure were an absolute pleasure to work with. Received a bilateral salpingectomy with IUD removal. Dr Sato will commence working at this location in September. 

[John Abano, MD](https://vasectomycenter.com/) Had my vasectomy completed January 2022 CF 24m in a relationship. No consultation was required for me, quick and easy set up for an appointment. Insurance in Washington is required to fully cover vasectomies. I had out of state insurance and I still only paid $30 for the procedure. John was a very nice and pleasant doctor. No bingos except the offer to freeze sperm (which I naturally refused). However, one thing to note is right before surgery I did receive a packet/waiver because I was under 30 with no kids that outlined some points that borderlined bingos. It was odd but didn't really take away due to no pressure or anything from the doctor, office aids and assistants to seriously read or discuss, felt like just a general intake form. Total time was 30min for procedure with 10 min of waiting. Overall I highly recommend this doctor for kindness and the affordability towards out of state insurance.

**Kirkland** 

Mary Berret, OB-GYN. I am a 34yo F who underwent bisalp yesterday! Dr. Barret was professional, empathetic, and efficient. She took me seriously and didn’t question my decision beyond informing me that it is permanent. She didn’t even ask if I had a partner! She scheduled me for surgery within a month of my consult, and was very helpful in making sure my insurance covered the surgery. I felt respected in every step of the process. Highly recommend Dr. Barret!

[Dr Bonnie Gong](https://www.womenshealthcare.org/bonnie-gong/) Unified Center for Women's Health in Kirkland, WA. Procedure: Bilateral salpingectomy. She is currently my gynaecologist and performed my bisalp a few months ago. She approved my sterilization during our first consultation and did not bingo me once.

[Dr. Stephen Hyde] (http://www.evergreenwomenscare.com/dr.-hyde.html) Asked a lot of questions of course but when I asked if he even wanted to speak to my husband he said I was an adult and could make my own decisions. Does Essure, Tubal Ligation and others that I don't remember.

[Dr. Pilar Baquero] (https://www.evergreenhealth.com/dr-pilar-baquero-md-ob-gyn-gynecology) Asked no questions about why I was choosing to have a bilateral salpingectomy other than if I was a: sure and b: knew of other options. Was sensitive in her language to gender and sexual identity ("are you in a stable, long-term relationship?" instead of "are you married", etc.). Very clear and straightforward with information. Specializes in minimally invasive procedures like laparoscopy, menstrual disorders, and gynecological surgeries.

[Dr. Chao-Ching Wu] (https://www.evergreenhealth.com/dr-chao-ching-wu-md-internal-medicine-pediatrics) Primary care physician. Very informative, clear, straightforward. Very compassionate. Gave an excellent reference to an OBGYN who could perform sterilization surgery, didn't ask any questions beyond the basics, was very understanding of why someone would choose this path.

[Dr Daniel Bahnmiller] Practices at Columbia Shores. Did a total Hysterectomy on me at 21 when I came in with medical cause.

**Kitsap** 

Dr. Katherine J. Hebard, MD Kitsap OBGYN - bilatersal salpingectomy 24yo CF. Dr. Hebard was the second doctor that I had a consult with through Kitsap OBGYN. She was a breath of fresh air after all the push back I had received so far. She was very informative about the entire process and took some time to make sure I understood the permanent nature of the procedure. After that, she was very supportive of me being able to make my own informed decision. On the day of the procedure, I was one of 3 women getting a bisalp from Dr Hebard. Everything went well, and she even diagnosed and removed some endometriosis from my abdominal wall.

Dr. Jennifer Quimby, MD. Performed tubal ligation on myself, supported all of my decisions without showing any judgement

[Dr. Glen Christen, MD](https://www.thedoctorsclinic.com/physicians/glen-christen.aspx).  Performed my bilateral salpingectomy Jan 2020 at age 21 with no bingos and also let me have my tubes returned to me.  

+1 Dr. Glen Christen.  He performed my tubal ligation December 2019. I was 32. Very friendly and never gave me any push back.  Just wanted to make sure I understood what the surgery entailed, being a plus size person the surgery can be a little bit more difficult but it went smoothly.   

+1 Dr Glen Christen, sterilisation for 29F.   

[Dr. Lydia Weyenberg](https://www.pchsweb.org/providers/lydia-weyenberg-md-facog/) in Kitsap County, Washington State. I'm 23, no children. She was hesitant because I was so young and did ask me to take a referral with one of her colleagues (only if I wanted too). She was always professional and made sure I knew it was always my choice. She made me feel comfortable and never belittled me. I got a tubal ligation done on May 24th, 2022.

**Moscow** 

[Dr. Ric Minudri](https://moscowpullmanobgyn.com/). Bilateral salpingectomy on unmarried, childless 21F. Practices in both Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington. He was incredibly willing to do the procedure. He said it was his job to help me live the life I want to live. He explained everything in an easy-to-understand way and wanted to get me the procedure as early as I wanted it done! 

**Mount Lake Terrace**

Dr.  James R Downey, MD. No bingos during the consultation. Asked me how many kids I had and approved it when I said zero. I didn't have to talk him into doing it at all. 

**Mount Vernon**

I was not married for either procedure. Skagit Regional Clinics - Mount Vernon 1400 E Kincaid Street Mount Vernon, WAshington 98274

[Dr. Melissa Chinn, DO at Chinn GYN] (http://www.chinngyn.com) Dr. Chinn is very open about her displeasure with doctors who discourage childfree people. She's non-judgemental and when I said I (23F) do not want kids she replied with "good!" She's very personable and a breath of fresh air. She does laparoscopic salpingectomies (no Essure) and will do referrals for males to get vasectomies and will work on a plan for back up birth control while his sterility is being confirmed. She will also assist with abortions. Her office is private practice and does not contract with insurance, but will help with reimbursement and will bill insurance for tests and what not. She operates out of an ambulatory surgical center that I assume will bill insurance. 

**Olympia**

[Dr. Michael Klotz] (http://www.ghc.org/). Practices at Group Health Olympia. Was willing to provide me the hysterectomy I wanted, and also was willing to provide a tubal ligation or ablation if I had been interested.

Multiple doctors at [South Sound Women's Health Center] (http://www.southsoundwomenscenter.com/index.php), Essure and Tubal Ligation - A user reports that Dr. Baker at this Health Center will not sterilize individuals under 30. However, there are other doctors who are willing.

Olympia Obstetrics & Gynecology, and even more specifically Dr. Laurie Sorenson, will do BTLs and hysterectomies for childfree people. Dr. Darrell Bell will also do both of these, but is much harder to schedule with. Patients need to be able to assert that this isn't a fluke decision but the doctors don't have age restrictions beyond legal requirements for consent. 

Dr. Kym Walker at South Sound Women's Center in Olympia, WA performed a laporoscopic bilateral salpingectomy for me. This facility is already on the list but it only mentions Essure and tubal ligation so I wanted to provide the update that they will also do bisalps. She did not make me jump through hoops or ask my husband's "permission" (he didn't come with me to the consultation). 25F with no children. 

Dr. Tim Zola - southsoundvasectomy@gmail.com

**Port Orchard** 

[Dr. Melissa Lo] (https://www.thedoctorsclinic.com/locations/port-orchard.aspx)  Asked me once what my reasonings for being CF, said I was old enough to make my own decisions without needing permission from anyone else. Performed a laprascopic bilateral salpingectomy with no issues; 27f at time of surgery.

St. Francis Urology Associates.  These providers have offices all over the state but Port Orchard is where I scheduled my appointment.  They offer a discount if you pay with cash (no insurance) and are relatively cheap compared to other places.  As long as you're 18 years of age they won't give you a hard time!

**Poulsbo** 

[Dr Chris Adrig](https://www.thedoctorsclinic.com/providers/chris-adrig-pa-c/) Dr Adrig does family medicine and isn’t an obgyn but he wrote me (single 31 female no kids) a referral for a tubal ligation with practically no questions asked.

[Diana Badkoobeh](https://www.multicare.org/provider/diana-badkoobeh/) (MD) at Multi-Care Women's Health Center in Puyallup, Washington, USA. I really cannot stress enough how amazing my experience with her was. For context, I am a 21 year-old woman, unmarried, and do not have any children of my own, nor do I want any as I am staunchly childfree. My first appointment with her was for a well-women exam, not a sterilization consultation, but I decided to mention wanting a bilateral salpingectomy anyway. I didn't expect her to be so supportive of it, but she said, "You've clearly given this a lot of thought and I trust you know what's best for yourself. After the exam I'll go print out the consent form and let's see if we can get you scheduled." No bingos, no judgment. I had my salpingectomy on the 24th! She's the best and I just know she will help so many others get their surgeries.

**Redmond** 

[Dr. John Steele Mullen] (https://www.swedish.org/swedish-physicians/profile.aspx?name=mullen+john+s&amp;amp;id=157770) James Surgical Specialists (inside Swedish). performed a vasectomy on my 26-year-old husband with little more than a cursory "so you don't want kids? Cool." Dr. Mullen talked us through the procedure and made sure we had instructions for care afterwards. Friendly, straightforward, and no bingos.

**Richland**

[Kris F. Kobalter, M.D.](https://www.providence.org/doctors/obstetrics-and-gynecology/wa/richland/kris-kobalter-1255302972?ls=provider&y_source=1_NDQxMzM2ODEtNzE1LWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D
) Kadlec Clinic Associated Physicians for Women, 945 Goethals Drive, Suite 200, Richland, Washington 99352. I received a bilateral salpingectomy in 2021. I am F[28], married, never had children. The procedure was fully covered by insurance since it was considered preventative care. He asked me if I was certain about going through with the procedure once during the consultation, and never questioned or instilled doubt after that. It was overall a great experience.

**Richmond** 

[Naeem T. Chavla, M.D.](https://washington-urology.com/) Richland WA, 99354, Vasectomy. 27m, engaged, childfree. Consultation on Friday, completed vasectomy the following Friday.

Feb 2023. Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy on 39-year-old CF redditor with endometriosis. Dr Ingrisano is the first OBGYN I've met who understands & supports my childfree choice, validated my experience, took me seriously & advocated for me with my insurance to cover the entire procedure. About a 1 month wait for surgery scheduling & currently 2 weeks post-op with no complications. A friend had the same procedure through the same clinic with a different doctor with an equally positive experience last year. I would 100% recommend Dr Ingrisano & the Gynecology dept at Swedish Hospital in Seattle to anyone seeking elective sterilization.

Rebecca Dunsmoor-Su Swedish Women’s Wellness, GYN specialities 600 Broadway, Suite 400 Seattle 98104 206-215-9071. "I am a gynecologist in Seattle. I will do bilateral salpingectomy over 21.

[Dr. Christina Jahncke](https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/christina-jahncke) 
Meridian Women's Health at Northwest Outpatient Medical Center, 10330 Meridian Ave. N, Seattle, WA 98133, 206-668-6644. Doctor’s statement: “I’m a generalist OB/GYN in Seattle. I’m employed by the University of Washington and operate at the UWMC Northwest campus. I’m LGBT+ friendly. I don’t have any age or relationship status limitations although I do like to discuss the range of options since progesterone IUDs have non-contraceptive benefits!"

[Dr Licia L. Raymond](https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/licia-raymond) at the UW Women's clinic. The Women's Clinic in general was highly recommended by my lgbtq friendly doctor and I asked specifically about a bilateral salpingectomy. I was really nervous about getting bingoed or questioned but since they were recommended I had high hopes. I went in to see Dr Raymond and filled out the forms as saying that I had tokophobia. Not only did she have an excellent bedside manner but she stunned me by suggesting we could do an all in one via a laparoscopic procedure, check for endometriosis, remove my appendix, and do the bilateral salpingectomy I wasn't questioned, bingoed, or anything, and she focused on things like the risk reduction of ovarian cancer and assured me that it was the salpingectomy over a tubal ligation and that tubals are not the standard anymore. OP is in their late 30's and younger patients may not have as good a result. 

[Dr. Mallory Kremer](https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/mallory-kremer), OB/GYN, UW Medicine. Approved a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy at 28 without hesitation after going through my reasoning and explaining the risks. She is the sweetest doctor, very understanding, and helpful. Initially saw her at the UW Shoreline Clinic and had the surgery at the UWMC. Addendum from another user: Dr. Kremer sterilized me via laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy at 22F without hesitation. She also removed my IUD after my bisalp was complete. During the consult, she was impressed by the binder and told me she would approve anyone over 21 who is firm in their choice. She is the absolute sweetest, and I felt respected and understood by her the whole time.)

+1 Dr Kremer, I just went in for a consultation, explained how I have never wanted to be pregnant in my life, am terrified of pregnancy and do not want to have children and she just explained the different types of birth control (because the laws require her to which she stated haha) and we proceeded. I’m 30 years old and have no children! I highly recommend her and my care team for the surgery itself were amazing and lovely. Just be aware that UW is a teaching hospital so there will always be residents and fellowships around (which i do not have a problem with).

[Dr. Maahum A. Haider](https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/maahum-haider), Urology, UW Medicine Roosevelt - Vasectomy.  She is very professional, ensures that her patients know the gist of the vasectomy process, that it's permanent, and the risks involved.  I got a green light very easily and she listened to my reasoning for requesting the procedure and took it seriously.  In short, she's fantastic. (Update 13 July 2021 - another member reports Dr Haider no longer performs vasectomies).

[Dr. Katherine A. McLean] (https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/katherine-mclean), Obstetrics and Gynecology, UW Medicine Ballard Clinic - Bilateral Salpingectomy. She believes that once you are 21 you should get to choose what you do with your body. Discussed many birth control options first since she wants everyone to have the correct info. Was super nice and didn't question me wanting the Bi Salp at all. She was even open to doing a hysterectomy because of my family history with fibroids. I was 25 when she did the procedure for me. I would definitely recommend her.

[Dr. Emma Swingle, Qliance Seattle](http://qliance.com/dr-emma-swingle/) - My GP, whom I can't recommend highly enough. Lovely woman - very pleasant and personable, non-judgmental, a great educator, and genuinely interested in you and your health. She had absolutely no problems referring me for a tubal ligation, and she has never once made me feel weird for being childfree. Bonus: she's also body/size positive!

[The Vasectomy Clinic](http://www.thevasectomyclinic.com/) Gave my husband his vasectomy a week before his 23rd birthday. Also offers free fertility testing for life. NB this practice does not take Cigna. 

+1  "Dr. Snip" The Vasectomy Clinic is a private practice founded in Seattle in 1987 by Charles L. Wilson, M.D. to focus on comfort and convenience for vasectomy patients. 

[Dr. Joseph Marquez](https://polyclinic.com/dr_joseph_marquez) Performed my no-needle/no-scalpel vasectomy. All he asked was whether I was sure I never wanted kids. [2018 Feb 21 | Addendum from another user : he is willing to do both open ended and close ended vasectomies? He was the only urologist or doctor specializing in vasectomies in the entire city I could find that was willing to do an open ended vasectomy and I want to make sure others are aware for when they are looking to avoid wasting time like I did if they want an open ended vasectomy. I'm 28]

Dr. Emily Norland. Practices at The Polyclinic. Willing to provide hysterectomy, ablation, etc. 206-860-4541

Dr. Ellen Wilber.  Practices at the Polyclinic (206-860-4541, https://polyclinic.com/obgyn).  Very knowledgable, kind and thorough.  Performs tubals, salpingectomies, and I believe inserts IUD's.  Will fix women over 30 without hesitation.  For those under 30, only if they're absolutely sure. - (1/8/18 - Refused me as I'm under 30 [29 and 8 months old], has scheduled 2 more appointments for testing and to establish a history.)

[Dr. Ali Lewis](http://meridianwomenhealth.com/ali-lewis-meridian-womens-health.html). Meridian Women's Health. Will perform tubal ligations on younger patients, even if they are without children. Doesn't require persuading, just surety that you want it.

[Kaiser Permanente Capitol Hill Women's Health](https://wa.kaiserpermanente.org/html/public/locations/capitol-hill). My GP referred me to Dr. Andrew Warner for a consultation, who was honest, open-minded and very nice, and Dr. Errett Story did my actual procedure. The entire process with everyone I talked to from KP was the best I could hope for.

+1 Dr. Warner Feb 2023. I am 32/f/childfree and just got my bisalp done yesterday. Dr. Warner has the best bedside manner of any gynecologist I’ve been to and it was so easy to get on the books for my procedure - he asked the usual questions just because he had to, but was supportive and incredibly thorough. I can’t recommend him enough.

[Dr. Sue Moreni](http://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/sue-moreni) at UW Medicine. Very understanding and willing to perform permanent sterilization procedures on women without children in their early 20s. There is a 30-day waiting period between signing the forms and the actual operation.

Dr. Elizabeth Micks and Dr. Karin Hayashida, formerly at UW Medicine Roosevelt are now practicing in Eureka CA and Honolulu HI respectively. 

[Dr. Philip Welch](http://www.swedish.org/swedish-physicians/profile.aspx?name=welch+philip+david&amp;amp;id=158009) Operates out of Swedish on Broadway and is a real nice dude. Believes everyone has a right to make their own life/body decisions and fully (without question) agreed to my choice to have a tubal ligation at age 23. Answers any and all questions thoroughly and has his office phone forwarded to his cell after hours so you can call with any concerns pre/post procedure.

-1 Dr Welch Agreed to my choice to have a tubal ligation at 20 years old, but refused to perform a bilateral salpingectomy due to low reversibility (he was cautious due to my age) and a slightly more intensive surgery. Compromised by agreeing to a tubal ligation, but with two methods: falope ring, which he specializes in, as well as cautery on either side of the ring. Very nice and will even rant about how frustrated he is that other doctors will not agree to sterilize women due to their age.

Dr. Megan Loring - Dr. Loring is highly competent, supportive, and professional. She performed my hysterectomy when I was 31 (after I was already sterilized) with no hesitation and never once questioned my childfree position. She was so patient and helpful in answering all my questions without judgment and making me feel fully comfortable with the process.

Dr. Steven Han: (https://schedule.swedish.org/doctors/urology/wa/issaquah/steven-han-1013033190). Vasectomy done at 20yo.

Dr. Marisa Dahlman at Virginia Mason Seattle, Washington and my GYN was Susan Sandblom ARNP at Virginia Mason University Village in Seattle, Washington. Bilateral Salpingectomy. Both were entirely trusting in my decision to be child free and open to allowing me to seek sterilization at 26.

Dr. Anna Walton, Dr. Judith Kimelman - Seattle OB/GYN. I requested to see a provider at Seattle OB/GYN who was willing to do nulliparous female sterilization. Got scheduled with Dr. Walton, I had an educational binder with my request letter and associated academic research ready for discussion, she was receptive and educated me on the risks and benefits, I got approved on the spot. I have some complex health issues for surgery, but she was willing to take on my higher risk case and conducted the surgery with the assistance of her mentor Dr. Kimelman. I had my surgery done at Swedish First Hill, had lots of pre-op tests, had the surgery and went home same day. Dr. Walton is very smart and funny, she has great bedside manner too.

[Dr. Katherine Schwab](https://schedule.swedish.org/directory/obstetrics-and-gynecology/904-7th-avenue-187849-788051) The Polyclinic Madison in Seattle, WA. She performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me, a 35 year old woman with no kids, without question. Very funny and kind, absolutely no bingo (in fact, she was happy for me to make that choice). Excellent bedside manner, too. This doctor advised our member that she has sterilised a 21yo also. 

+1 Dr Schwab - Laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. 22F, currently in a relationship, no children. Procedure completed 2022. She’s extremely nice and never pushed me towards other birth control options, and never brought up my age. She and her team are excellent and will help you with whatever you need. 

+1 Dr Schwab, she just approved me to get sterilized at 22 with no bingos, no BS. As soon as I asked, she said "the short answer is yes" but that she had to ask me some questions for the record (what birth control I've tried, why I want the procedure). I had a whole speech prepared but she stopped me early and said "knowing that you don't want kids is good enough." She cited stats about how most childfree people don't regret getting sterilized, and said that she likes being as supportive as she can because she knows how many hoops women have to go through just to have bodily autonomy

+1 Dr Schwab, she performed my (F22) bisalp. She listened thoughtfully and was extremely supportive of my decision. She will also send you before/after pictures of your insides if that interests you!

[Dr. Vivienne Meljen SeaMar Vancouver Women's Health Clinic](https://www.seamar.org/medical-providers/vivienne-meljen.html) - Bilateral tubal sterilization.

[Dr. Joanna Zhou](https://www.polyclinic.com/locations-nav/providers/wa/joanna-zhou-md/1497118905.html), not only listened to me but went straight to suggesting a bisalp without questioning me about why I wanted sterilization. She didn't ask a single question about my relationship or what my partner thought about my choice, she only cared about what I wanted and didn't question me for one second. I'm 31F, my experience was awesome with her. In fact, she's cf herself and we agreed on not understanding why anyone would want to have kids in this day and age. Really great doctor and got the process started for my sterilization!

+1 Dr Joanna Zhou and Dr Christina Jahncke, I first met with Dr. Zhou in September '22 but due to when I wanted my procedure done I got shifted to Dr Jahncke. Both of them listened to me (32F) and I expected even a little bit of pushback but didn't receive any. It was recorded in my history that I had asked about sterilization back in 2017 at a different facility so they knew I'd been thinking about it for a long time. My procedure was on the 28th of December and everyone was great.

+1 Dr. Zhou. Feb 2023, Bisalp on 18 year old redditor with Ehler-Danlos syndrome. EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD! Dr. Zhou was entirely respectful, helpful and gave no pushback, in part because redditor came in well prepared, with a carefully constructed sterilization binder. Redditor's story is here:https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/11c70fb/my_journey_getting_sterilized_18f_wa_state/. 

[Rebecca Kulgren MD](https://www.polyclinic.com/provider-lookup/provider-detail-page.html?npi=1578744199) in Seattle Washington. She performed my (27F) biscalp. She had 0 bingos and was willing to approve me immediately. She is a huge advocate for personal choice and has said she has done sterilization on female patients as young as 18. I live an hour and a half away from her office and she was very considerate of my time. It was a very seamless process with an incredible provider.

[Dr Regina Lagalbo](https://www.polyclinic.com/locations-nav/providers/wa/regina-lagalbo-md-facog/1104995851.html), Seattle, WA, USA. Bilateral salpingectomy. 32F Single (she did not ask about my marital status) CF status: Have never been pregnant and never wanted to be. Dr Lagalbo was super understanding and empathetic every step of the way when it came to my bilateral salpingectomy! She didn't even come close to Bingo-ing me; she simply told me she was required to share that the procedure was permanent and irreversible. I told her I understood, and that was it.

[Dr. Joelle Thomas](practice:https://www.seaobgyn.com/), I (27F) completed a bisalp. I am currently engaged and childfree. Dr. Thomas listened to my saying I didn't want children and didn't require a dissertation as to why I didn't want them. She took her time, answered all my questions, and made me feel comfortable. We had to sign a prior authorization and wait 30 days to perform the procedure per Washington's state's medicaid guidelines.

Did not give me any trouble for being younger or not having kids beforehand. Was very professional. I found it helped to be super prepared but he let me know that he's performed it on younger people than me without children as well. He was able to get me in on a cancellation and he combined my consultation and pre-op so I only had to have one appointment before the actual surgery. Sept. 2022.

**Spokane**

Dawn Kopp, MD, MPH Primary Practice Location: Northwest Ob/Gyn, Spokane, WA. This gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "This is a private practice. My practice takes most insurances: private and public. I'm an Ob/Gyn physician in Spokane, WA that does bilateral salpingectomy sterilization for childfree people over 21 years old.

[Dr. John McKenna]  (http://www.nswomenshealth.com/) at North Spokane Women's Health. I called the office and asked if they perform tubal ligation on women under 30, right off the bat she said yes and scheduled me a consult. Dr. McKenna was very professional and never spoke down to me or questioned my ability to know what I wanted. 30 day wait period from initial consult to surgery, but I had my surgery scheduled within 2 wks from my consult. [MOD NOTE 2018/08/16 : from a subscriber : "no longer does tubals or any permanent surgeries. He agreed to do mine then a week later had his nurse call me and tell me he no longer did them"]

Dr. Levi Deters - Spokane Urology - (Vasectomy at 26, unmarried with no kids)

[Dr. Eric Tyler](https://www.spokaneobgyn.com/welcome-eric-m-tyler-md/) He performed a laparoscopic hysterectomy on me (23F, single, no kids)

[Dr. Jody Hechtman](https://www.providence.org/doctors/obstetrics-and-gynecology/wa/spokane/jody-hechtman-1871518456) - OB/GYN Associates of Spokane. Amazing doctor! You have full autonomy of your body with her. Provides sterilization without any judgement. I recommend her to all my friends. NB Dr Hechtman has joined a hospital that does not allow her to perform sterilisation procedures except for in very rare circumstances. 

+1 Dr Hechtman, She is supportive of women's rights to bodily autonomy and is one of the few doctors in the more conservative area of Spokane, WA that will do it. She also later performed my hysterectomy. She treated me with dignity and is a great surgeon and OB.

Elizabeth Newell, MD FACOG. This gynecologist has reached out to us directly to advise, "Currently employed at Northwest OB/Gyn in Spokane WA office phone 5094555050 is preferred. Not everyone in my practice is similar on this so wouldn’t refer to all of my partners right now. I may be changing jobs later this year will update you when that happens. No prior obligations, just needs to be legal (age restriction is 21 yo I believe) and of mental capacity to make their own decisions (no psych appt needed, as a surgeon I can make this decision and determine capability of consent with my patient). Also preferred method is a bilateral salpingectomy to reduce risk of pregnancy/conception unplanned and prevent ovarian cancer risk"

[Dr. Ramsay Larson MD OBGYN]( https://www.multicare.org/provider/ramsey-larson/) MultiCare Rockwood Clinic - OB/GYN & Midwifery Center, 910 W 5th Ave, Suite 300, Spokane, WA 99204 509-755-5205. Bisalp. She didn’t push back on my decision at all and stated that it is the women who have never had children who are the least likely to regret being sterilized. She was very supportive of my decision.

**Tacoma** 

Dr Azari of the MultiCare Women's Health - Tacoma, WA clinic. He's doing a tubal for me no real questions asked. I'm 33F and married, and he agreed even before I mentioned my hubbs had a (failed) vasectomy. The entire clinic is superb - they really let the individual woman decide her own health care. Didn't bingo me once and didn't push hormonal BC or an IUD. Only brought up the chance of regret once, and more in passing.

MultiCare Urology of Tacoma.  For those who are at least 21 years of age.

[Dr. Ory Holtzman](https://wa-clinician.kaiserpermanente.org/womens-health-care/73736/) preformed my bilateral salpingectomy at 28, married with no children. Very kind, never questioned my decision, just made sure I knew it was irreversible.

[Dr. Stephen Maynard](https://www.rainierobgyn.com/) agreed to perform my bisalp at age 22 without judgment or any "bingos". He was very respectful and explained everything thoroughly. His office is located in Tacoma, WA. 

+1 Dr Maynard, 27 yo, no children, no history of any medical issues related to reproductive organs. Previously tried BC pills, IUD. Dr. Maynard was amazing, as was the surgical team at Tacoma General. He was extremely kind, easy going and made the entire process comfortable and straight forward. Our conversations were based off of being well informed, no bingoes, doubt, or judgement. He wanted to make sure I knew the procedure was permanent and that I had all of my questions answered. He went into detail about the process and I was scheduled quickly. Super cool guy. He does the procedure laparoscopically so it's minimally invasive and the recovery has been super easy for me (I'm on Day 2).

**Vancouver** 

Gregory Mallek, MD. OBGYN Sea Mar Salmon Creek Women's Clinic, Vancouver, WA, 360-892-0208. We are a FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center). We take all insurances including Medicare/Medicaid. Can work out no insurance (hospital charges for surgery are the biggest $$). LGBTQ+ Friendly. Limitations: Age 21+ for sterilization. No marital status or child limitations. Anatomy limitations: Fallopian tubes (I am not trained in vasectomies)

Dr. Andrea Chiavarini, [Vancouver Clinic](https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-andrea-chiavarini-xxgj3_) (tubal)

Dr. Adrienne Heckler, [Vancouver Clinic] (https://tvc.org/providers/adrienne-heckler-md) (vasectomy).  For the consultation, she just wanted to make sure that I was well-informed (i.e., this is a permanent solution, freezing sperm can't guarantee IVF, reversal is costly and does not restore full fertility, and young people are those most likely to change their minds).  I accepted this, she gave absolutely no lectures or bingoes, and she did the procedure in just a few minutes at a second appointment.  She's a respectful and cheerful doctor to work with.

Michael S. Farber, [PeaceHealth](https://www.peacehealth.org/findadoc/care-providers/5910/michael-s-farber-md) (Bilateral Salpingectomy, 30yo). He wanted to be sure I was aware of all my options, and informed. When I made it clear I've wanted sterilization for a long time and this was the only option for me he had no pushback and scheduled it gladly. Very kind and respectful doctor who made it clear it was my choice. Bilateral Salpingectomy, 30yo. 

Dr. Allison Higgins, [PeaceHealth] (https://www.peacehealth.org/findadoc/care-providers/5432/allison-l-higgins-md) (bilateral salpingectomy)

Dr. Michael Klotz [PeaceHealth] (https://www.peacehealth.org/findadoc/care-providers/6868/michael-m-klotz-md) (bilateral salpingectomy) He was so kind and respectful. No bingoes, no unnecessary questions. I can't recommend him enough.

Dr. Miriam Ruth [The Vancouver Clinic, Columbia Tech Center Location] (https://tvc.org/providers/miriam-ruth-md/) Did not try to lecture me or change my mind at all, was very understanding and informative. There was no push back, or comments that made me feel degraded. 

**Walla Walla** 

[Andrew Fluckiger](https://www.wallawallaclinic.com/services/womens-clinic/). I had a bilateral salpingectomy, at 25 years old, not married with no partner, and 100% childfree. I was expecting to be referred out, but instead there were no bingos and he just asked if this is what I wanted. He stated many times "that the more we listen to women, the better doctors we will be." There was a minimum wait time of 30 days, but that was due to insurance. Expecting 100% insurance coverage for the surgery. Costs are expected to be only co-pays for the consult appt, pre-op appt, and post-op check up. No bingos and very open minded. Surgery was simple and recovery was quick, staff were caring and listened.

**Wenatchee** 

Bridget Kamen, MD at Confluence Obstetrics and Gynecology in Wenatchee Washington 933 RED APPLE ROAD WENATCHEE WA 98801 509-433-3203. The only questions she asked were due diligence. Just my reasons..I said I am child free... don't want kids. Asked if hubby and I were on same page, said yup. . Asked about the possibility of implant, said nope want to avoid hormones, just one question and no rebuttal..ok, how about IUD? I Actually did try - cervix said no thanks. Noted, again one question, acceptance. Hubby getting snipped. Told her it's an act of Congress for him to go to a doctor. Said ah, one of those guys. Ok sounds like you know what you want. , if you want you can sign the consent form now and call to schedule. NB OP is 40+ therefore younger prospective patients may encounter more resistance. Be very ready with anti-bingoes and responses to why temporary birth control isn't suitable for you. The doctor has advised she is open to sterilising younger people but this is as yet unverified.  

+1 Bridget Kamen of Wenatchee, WA on the approved doctor list. I was 33 when I got a tubal ligation. She asked the necessary questions for insurance approval of the procedure. I was married and did have my husband with me, but she never addressed any questions to him or made me feel like she was seeking his approval. The consult was quick, got me in for the tubal in less than a week, and I felt no judgement from her about my choice. I will say I have a severe chronic illness and a long history of medication that I’m not supposed to get pregnant while taking which could have contributed in her easy agreement.

**Yakima** 

[Dr Noah Qualls](https://www.yakimamemorial.org/provider-directory/providers/noah-j-qualls-md/), I am an OBGYN who is happy to provide sterilization and family planning care. In addition, I also strongly emphasize trauma informed care and LGBTQ+ friendly care.

[Dr. Carly Ingalls, M.D.](https://www.yakimamemorial.org/provider-directory/providers/carly-m-ingalls-md/). I had my bi-lateral salpingectomy October 3rd, 2022. Single, 37, childfree. The first time I met Dr. Ingalls was for my consultation for my LEEP and I asked her about sterilization and she was on board right away, no bingos, nothing. At my pre-surgery appointment she explained the surgery very thoroughly, answered all of my questions. Highly recommend her. This doctor has advised she won't sterilise below 18. 

###WASHINGTON, D.C

**Downtown** 

[Dr. Katherine Garfield OBGYN](https://www.cwcare.net/profile-provider/515). Bisalp, I am 30, married, and childfree. The whole process was easy - Dr. Garfield did not question my desire to not have children and said it was a great reason to get a bisalp done. She was also able to replace my IUD during the surgery (needed for non-bc reasons). My surgery was scheduled 2 months after the pre-op appointment, so wait time was relatively short.

**American University Park** 

[Dr. Robert Footer](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/Robert-Footer) - he supported my bilateral salpingectomy as a childfree, unmarried 24F. I was sent to him by my original OB/GYN for a secondary consultation before my surgery. My original doctor was rather patronizing, and while he did approve the surgery, he wanted Dr. Footer to consult with me beforehand. Dr. Footer allowed me to fully explain my situation and reasoning without interruption, and immediately said he finds no reason why any doctor would refuse me since it was clear I had thought this out thoroughly. Absolutely no bingos (unlike my other doctor), no wait time, and was completely covered by my insurance.

-1 Dr Footer, was patronising to another (30yo) member and "he made a note in my file referring to me as an 'emotionally unstable 30 year old' and noted an unstable personality disorder diagnosis that he apparently discussed with me during our appointment. To be clear, he never discussed anything of the sort during our meetings."

**Washington Circle** 

[Dr. Frederick Hendricks] (http://www.gwdocs.com/urology-urologic-surgery/frederick-hendricks) Asked the usual marriage and kids questions, but says it's your decision just sound firm about getting one. Vasectomy, 19 male, no kids and single.

**Foggy Bottom** 

[Dr Dipti Kumar](https://www.obgyndc.com/doctors/dipti-kumar-m-d-facog). With Capital Women’s Care in Washington DC. This gynecologist has reached out to advise, "I would like to be on the list willing to do salpingectomies after consultations."

+1 Dr Kumar, "Doctor Dipti Kumar ... was wonderful, explained all of my options thoroughly, and ultimately performed the procedure after we determined it was best for me."

Dr. Katherine Garfield from Capital Women's Care in Washington D.C., originally Dr. Dipti Kumar from Capital Women's Care (already on the list) was scheduled to be my surgeon, but she got sick two days before. Dr. Garfield stepped into to my procedure. Just prior the the procedure she briefly went over other birth control options and regret, but no bingos. I talked to her post-op and she says she is willing to be on the the Childfree Doctor list and do Bisalps for other women.

[Dr. Amr Madkour, GWU Medical Faculty Associates OBGYN](https://www.gwdocs.com/find-a-doctor/amr-madkour-md/). Asked the normal why do you want to be sterilized, explained risks, and regrets, but allows it to be your decision. Bilateral Salpingectomy.

[Dr. Farnaz Farhi](https://gwdocs.com/profile/farnaz-farhi) performed a bilateral salpingectomy on me with no hesitation. Awesome bedside manner, and this process couldn't have been made easier. She works out of GW Hospital in Foggy Bottom.

[Dr. Marie Ann Draoui at Washington MedStar in Washington, DC](https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/marie-anne-draoui-md). Absolutely fabulous and caring surgeon. No concerns about me getting a bilateral salpingectomy during my consultation and very clearly and thoroughly explained the surgery process.

**Capitol Hill**

[Dr. Marsha Solomon, Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/marshasolomon). Asked the usual questions to explain risks, recommended sterilization procedures that would also help reduce risk of ovarian/cervical cancer. Said she just wants to see her patients happy. 29/afab, no kids.

Dr. Neeta Makhija, I’m an 18 year old that just got a bilateral salpingectomy at the Kaiser in Capitol Hill. To add, she put me under anesthesia for a general exam due to my ptsd. So, she also seems to be a good doctor for trauma patients (like me) that need accommodations. 

###WEST VIRGINIA

**Huntington**

[Kristin Sinning](https://www.marshallhealth.org/find-a-provider/provider-details/?ID=615). I am 27 and no children. It was my first appointment with her. When I told her I wanted a bilateral salpingectomy, she told me "I don't care if you're married, have kids, or never want kids. I believe that choice is my patient's and I will not get in their way" No bingos whatsoever. She did let me know it was permanent but she was very open and answered all my questions. She gave me consent form, we both signed, and scheduled the surgery during the same appointment.

+1 Dr Sinning approved a member for hysterectomy. 

+1 Dr. Sinning performed a bisalp on a 20-year-old member without any pushback or bingoes.

At the time I was 30, no kids, had a partner (not married). I was referred to her from my usual OBGYN since he no longer performs the procedure. He had me wait 6 months until I 30. I saw Dr. Hood one time, she asked me once what I wanted so she could document that I verbalized it, and then we made the appointment. My insurance covered it 100%.

**Beckley**

[Dr. Gina Jerez-Harris](https://www.accesshealthwv.com/locations/obgyn-clinic/) AccessHealth OBGYN 410 Carriage Drive Beckley, West Virgina 25801 (304) 255-1541 
I'm 26F (surgery was done when I was 25) married, no kids. I had a bilateral salpingectomy. Scheduled a consultation, I told her I wanted to be sterilized, she made sure I knew it was permanent and informed me of the risks of surgery. I was never bingoed not even by the staff, which are also amazing. West Virginia Medicaid does require a 30 day waiting period (but will fully cover it), we scheduled 30 days exactly because she knew how bad I wanted to be sterilized and she didn't want to make me wait any longer than what was minimally required.

Dr. Lynnetta Payne - Beckley, WV - https://www.raleighgeneralmedicalgroup.com/our-practices/advanced-urology
I'm 28/M. All she asked was 'so you're here to get snipped, you sure?' Then she proceeded to tell me about the procedure and post-surgery. She's super knowledgeable and easy to talk with. Awesome experience.

[Dr. Lindley](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.accesshealthwv.com/locations/obgyn-clinic/&ved=2ahUKEwjB-dfjzc_6AhXFF2IAHdMkDAUQFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0uc3-WfQGPc-tnffhAHlEq), 410 Carriage Dr, Beckley, WV 25801. 304-255-1541. I had to be 21 in order to officially sign the papers, which was the only stipulation. Bilateral salpingectomy, 22yo. 100% childfree. He just asked if I was sure it was what I wanted and made sure I knew it was permanent, and me understanding that and being sure was all he wanted to know. 

Dr. Rae Anne Bailey, approved OP for tubal ligation.

[Dr. Dara Aliff, DO, FACOG]( https://premierwv.com/) Premier Women's Health, 1003 Oakhurst Dr, Charleston, WV 25314 (304) 720-4455. Bisalp on 32F CF who already had silicone band sterilization surgery, without pushback or bingoes. Arranged for insurance to cover treatment, which it did because of high failure rate of band surgery and because of family history of reproductive cancers. Bisalp was competently performed using most current methods, patient was given truthful information, and post-surgical discomfort was minimal. Doctor and staff were helpful and kind. Surgery was performed at CAMC Women's and Children's which is very efficient and well organized.

[Dr. David J. Patton OBGYN] (https://drpatton.com/) 108 Washington St W., Charleston, WV, 25302, 304-345-4525/100 N Heights Dr., Beckley, WV, 25801, 304-253-7550.

I requested a tubal ligation and he didn't even ask questions. Just made sure my insurance would work with the request. I requested it in his office and the surgery was done at CAMC Women's and Children's. I'm a 26 year old single female and I got a tubal ligation with Fallopian rings.

Dr. Stephen Bush, CAMC Women's & Children's Hospital, Charleston ,WV

[Randall J. Hill, MD FACOG](https://www.randalljhillmd.com/) I'm 21F, no kids. He didn't give me any bingos, I just came with some important points scribbled on a notepad to read and he very quickly said as long as I was well informed it was my body and my decision I could make. He was non-judgemental and was happy to answer all of my questions. Highly recommend!

**Morgantown** 

[Kristan Hornsby, MD](https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/43796), bilateral salpingectomy. I'm 20, unmarried w/ significant other, and childfree. Dr. Hornsby was great about everything and working to get things done ASAP. No bingos, trans friendly, and very open and straightforward with explaining everything. I'd highly recommend seeing her if you're in the area.

[Dr. Sarah Dotson](https://wvumedicine.org/find-a-doctor/doctor-details/?id=805) WVU Cheat Lake Physicians/J. W. Ruby Memorial Hospital Morgantown, WV Bilateral Salpingectomy on 29 yo female with no children. Easy consultation. Just wanted verbal assurance I was 100% sure. Scheduled surgery at consultation and had availability within a month, but I chose to wait until the following month.

+1 Dr Dotson, I (19f) just today got a bilateral salpingectomy with Dr. Sarah Dotson in Morgantown, WV. She was amazing, just wanted to know if I for sure wanted the procedure. No bingo, no fighting. She heard me out and, while hesistant because of my age, she told me that it is not her job to tell me I'm too young, it's her job to provide safe surgery. She was lovely the entire time. 

[Dr Ossama Elsaccar](https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/39697). Bilateral Salpingectomy - 28, unmarried, no children. Brief to the point of being brusque, but moves quickly. Consultation was on 2/15/22, held virtually, and took less than ten minutes. Procedure was on 2/28/22. During the consultation, he simply asked why I wanted the procedure (I had prepared a lengthy explanation, but he was satisfied with “I want to move away from hormonal methods and do not ever want to be pregnant”) and verified that I understood it was permanent. Not a doctor who will offer emotional support, but if you have done your own research, know what you want, and want it done fast, highly recommend him.

+1 Dr Elsaccar, Bilateral salpingectomy on 25, unmarried, no children. I was referred to him by WVU Student Clinic, got an appointment in 2 weeks. He’s very direct; he just came in and explained tubal ligation vs salpingectomy, asked me which one I wanted (bisalp), made sure I knew that it was permanent and if I changed my mind IVF is not covered by my insurance. I signed consent forms right then and there and surgery was 2 months after that.

**Parkersburg** 

Dr. Patrick Dugan, Camden Clark Medical Center (Also called WVU Medicine) Urology. (Vasectomy). With a referral from my GP, had no qualms scheduling my surgery as long as I was 'totally sure' at 21 years old.

**South Charleston** 

Dr. Andrea Hill - 304-768-7770. 4607 MacCorkle Ave SW, South Charleston, West Virginia 25309 Suite 201. I had a bisalp. At the time 24F, unmarried, no kids. She approved me during my first appointment and the surgery was performed 28 days later. No bingos; her criteria for approval is basically just be 21, of sound mind, 100% sure, and no one is forcing you to do it. I did have to have a pap and pelvic, but she’s very gentle and quick.

**Weirton** 

Dr. John Luiza - All About Women, a hospital owned practice. This gynecologist has reached out to advise, "I will sterilize anyone over the age of 21 who is willing to accept the hypothetical risk of regret. We take many insurances including Highmark and medicaid from WV, Ohio, and PA. Although the practice name is heteronormative we are LGBTQIA friendly. I have no marital requirements. As of now I do not yet provide transition support."

Dr. Abigail Hoyle at Weirton Medical Center in Weirton, WV. I am 30 y.o., childfree, and married. I had a laparoscopic total bisalp with uterine ablation done last year in Nov 2022. After brief counseling I explained that I didn’t want children and she was very welcoming, accepting, and gave education regarding the procedure. The day of surgery went very smoothly, she did an excellent job on my procedure, and she gave adequate pre- and post-op medications for pain. I have recommended several of my friends to her. She said that as long as a patient was firm in their decision-making and understood that it would be a permanent procedure, she would be glad to help out even younger or unmarried folks.

**West Virginia** 

Dr. Anne Berry, Clendenin Health Center in Clendenin, West Virginia. Asked her for an IUD after my abortion (which she was aware of) and she put it in after helping me learn more about it, without any questions or concerns regarding having children, and was even excited for me since she knew I would feel better with the IUD.

###WISCONSIN

**Appleton** 

[Dr. Michael Werner](https://primarycareofappleton.com/Doctors-Staff/FamilyMedicine/Michael-Werner,-MD) - Primary Care Associates Appleton, WI. Performed vasectomy on 25 y.o. single male without asking very many questions. He believes that at this age, we are old enough to make our own decisions and truly treats people in their 20s as adults.

**Berlin** 

[Effie Siomos](https://www.womenscareofwi.com/providers/provider_522dcff13fa2/) - She performed a hysterectomy for me & one for my best friend when we were 25 and 26 due to a combo of health issues and a desire to not have children. she is also totally open to discussing permanent birth control measures with people who don't have a medical need for sterilization. she is just an awesome friendly, warm, and excellent doctor overall too. I cannot recommend her highly enough.

+1 Dr Siomos, I (childless 23f in a 2 yr relationship) found Dr. Siomos through the r/childfree subreddit and, after looking through some additional doctors in the area, decided to go with her for a consult. I'm glad I did, too. She went through the usual statistics with me but remained very kind throughout and I never felt pressured or judged by her at all. She understood all of my reasonings, especially with the current situation in the country, and said that she believes in full bodily-autonomy and that it's completely up to me with what I want to do with my body. Overall, she's a very kind woman who I would highly recommend for anyone interested in pursuing something like this.

**Eau Claire**

[Jennifer Bantz, OBGYN](https://mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jennifer-bantz-md) She goes thru the regular "Why do you want this? Risks, regrets, etc." thing, but says it is ultimately your decision. Bilateral Salpingectomy, 24+ years old. 

+1 Dr Bantz I'm 27/married/never pregnant, absolutely refuse to carry a pregnancy due to a rare-ish genetic condition. I requested to discuss an endometrial ablation and salpingectomy. She suggested considering either a hormonal IUD or hysterectomy instead. She patiently discussed pros and cons of both, without pressuring me either way. I opted to try the IUD first, but I'm confident that if that fails she'll "go nuclear" and help me get it all removed. She did ask how I came to my decision, and accepted the cliff notes version with no judgement when I was firm about why I was sure I'm not having any babies. She also read up on my condition (documented in my chart from another doc) before I came in so she'd have a better idea how to help. I truly feel like she's looking out for my best interests. Highly recommend.

[Jordan Crow, MD](https://www.oakleafclinics.com/provider.phtml/jordan_crow/) Dr Crow has contacted us directly and offers, "tubal or hysterectomy on any consenting adult". 

[Dr Blenda Yun](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/blenda-yun-md) from Mayo Clinic. I had an appointment with her fall of 2020 and had my surgery (bilateral salpingectomy) 1/19/2021. She listened to me from that first appointment and added me to the surgery list right away.

[Dr. Chris Longbella](https://www.oakleafclinics.com/provider.phtml/chris_longbella/). Bisalp + endometrial ablation when I was 20 (and single). Dr. Longbella is kind and informative. I don't recall him ever bingoing me, though he did require that I go to a counseling appointment for mental-health clearance before he would agree to go ahead with the procedure (maybe because of my age, don't remember though). Day-of, Dr. Longbella and the rest of the staff were great, making sure my questions were answered and that I was as comfortable as possible. 

**Green Bay** 

[Dr. Katrina Severance, DO](https://www.prevea.com/providers/provider-detail/Katrina-Severance) - Family Medicine Physician. Prevea Howard Health Center 2793 Lineville Road Green Bay, Wisconsin 54313 Phone: (920) 496-4700. Dr. Severance sent in a referral for my husband (an established patient - 37 years old) for a vasectomy upon him messaging her in the app stating he wanted one (no appointment necessary). He had it within 3 weeks after the referral. Dr. Severance also sent a request for myself (establish patient - 31 years old) to get a salpingectomy (tubal removal) right away upon asking. I had the surgery just a few weeks later. Dr. Severance also stated (when I asked) that she would have done it for both of us even if she didn’t know we were partners and/or wanted the same thing. She said “your body, your choice.” My husband and I both want to be child free. I also cannot safely have children due to medical reasons. It wouldn’t be safe for me or the baby (though you wouldn’t need a reason like this if you see her - she respects just wanting to be child free). She is a spectacular and empathetic Doctor!

[Deborah Sue Fischer](https://www.prevea.com/Providers/Deborah-Fischer?utm_campaign=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_source=local), MD. Prevea Health 1821 S Webster Ave Green Bay, WI 54301 Phone: (920) 496-4700. Dr. Fischer has the absolute kindness soul. About 8 years ago, I had traumatic experience with an insensitive doctor who used a giant metal speculum (unsuccessfully multiple times in a row to the point I was in pain and crying during a heavy cycle) to do a pap. That doctor then refused me birth control and my high blood pressure medication bc she could not complete the pap and I bc was at “child baring age” (the high blood pressure med could cause issues during a pregnancy - but I did not even have a partner at the time, nor did I ever want children). She would not listen to me no matter what I said. I marched my upset self down to the OBGYN department and explained my situation in tears to the front desk person. Our came Dr. Fischer who wrote my prescriptions that moment, scheduled a new appointment with her (after my period was over), and made me a patient of hers moving forward for all paps. Fast forward to not that long ago, I finally asked my (new) regular doctor if she could work with Dr. Fischer to help me with my period cycle and pain I was having. They did many tests and it turned out I also had PCOS. I was prescribed a medication to balance my hormones as well as a switch-up with my birth control. Long behold, my problem became much more manageable. Then - just recently - after 1 appointment (not more than 15 min.) I requested to be sterilized. I was scheduled for the surgery within a few weeks. No questioning. Just a kind, respectful doctor. She even held my hand as I got put under during surgery (I’m scared if the mask and the OR in general).

[Dr. Jory Ough](https://care.bellin.org/provider/Jory+A+Ough/2217388) through Bellin Health I had a bilateral salpingectomy, I am 27, single, and have no kids. I initially saw a NP who referred me to Dr. Ough, warning me i would need counseling etc. and could still be told no. once i met with Dr. Ough, this was not the case. I didn’t have to do any convincing. She had no hesitation and said “it’s your body, you can do whatever you want.” I HIGHLY recommend her and this surgery!

Amy Van Gheem, MD, this gynecologist has reached out directly to advise, "I am happy to offer sterilization to women who desire this". Wisconsin state law states must be 21.

[Dr. Sean McAdams](https://www.uroassocgb.com/providers/sean-mcadams-md/) with Urology Associates of Green Bay Wisconsin/Bellin performed a no-scalpel vasectomy on me and did a fantastic job of it! He used both clamps and cautery, advising that the use of both should make it functionally impossible for recanalization. I am a 22 y/o bi male with a monogamous female partner with no kids, not married. The form I filled out prior to coming in did ask about all those questions, but I wasn’t asked any further during the consult or the procedure. As far as bingos go, when I entered the consult they asked me to describe a vasectomy and what I knew about the procedure, it’s risks, benefits, etc. I gave an answer in medical terms, they asked “you’re sure you want this?” And that was that. Staff were very friendly throughout both visits, and outside of the consult no one questioned the decision. Took 2 months to get in. Cost out of pocket was around USD $1k, but that’s my insurance’s fault.

[Dr. Freund, pronounced Friend](https://care.bellin.org/meghan-freund-green-bay-wi-ob-gyn). Complete tubal removal / tubal salpingectomy. 25F, single, no kids. She asked once if I had tried/wanted to try any reversible, long-term options instead, and made sure that I knew the procedure was not reversible and would be expensive if I regretted it later. I only had to say once that I would not regret it and that I had made up my mind, and she approved me for the procedure in about 10 minutes. With my insurance (UHC/UMR) I have to wait 31 days before I can have a surgery. Aware of the recent Roe issue, and said that her office has had an uptick in calls relating to sterilization

**Fort Atkinson**

[Craig Kozler, Urologist](https://www.forthealthcare.com/physician/craig-kozler/) Gave zero crap about getting vasectomy due to not wanting kids. Did ask standard questions like do you have any children and why you wanted a vasectomy.

**Fox Valley**

(Dr. Eric Eberts, Dr. Marley Kercher and Dr. Amber Post, Women's care of Wisconsin) Dr. Eberts specializes in endometriosis and laparoscopy and is extremely understanding and respectful (no bingos or prioritizing fertility over pain management here). He took my concerns very seriously and was the first doctor I found in the Fox Valley who was willing to go straight to laparoscopic surgery to confirm endo right off the bat. (Wisconsin Institute of Urology - Oshkosh, Dr. Matthew Anderson - vasectomy www.wisurology.com)

[Dr. Maria Vandenberg](https://www.womenscareofwi.com/providers/provider_403565b96161/). She's based in the Fox Valley of Wisconsin but also Appleton, Wi. The clinic she works at has branches all over Northeastern Wisconsin (Women's Care of Wisconsin). I'm 30, Childfree. Dr. Vandenberg walked into my appointment room with a gleeful cheer of, "Yay! No babies!" She was super informative about everything and explained to me that Women's Care of Wisconsin will do salpingectomies on women, no questions asked. 

**Hudson** 

[Dr. Mark Stannard at Hudson Physicians in Hudson, Wisconsin](https://hudsonphysicians.com/provider/mark-stannard/). Dr. Stannard performed a no-scalpel vasectomy for me on July 28th, 2022. I was 25 at the time and partnered (with a man, but I’m bisexual,) and had been set in my childfree conviction for almost 10 years. I had a consult with Dr. Stannard on the 23rd. I told him the overturning of Roe v. Wade was the nudge I needed to go through with it, and he didn’t bingo me at all! He basically just asked me if I understood that it was to be considered irreversible, and then walked me through how the procedure would work. During the actual procedure, he even made a couple jokes that kept me in good spirits!

[Dr. Jill Cousino, Gyno-] (http://www.deancare.com/find-a-doctor-site-search-detail/?id=3258)(Now a maybe, she is hard to get into and started specializing in Delivery my last appt didn't sound as optimistic since she's reluctant to sign off on it now but perhaps in other situations she is? Still the best bedside manner in the area so she's super popular.) Went in to talk about BC options she does perform the Essure and is willing to sign off for tubal ligation. The clinic does permanent sterilization for 25+ unless medically needed earlier.

+1 Dr Schmehil-Micklos performed laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy on late 30s, married, cishet woman (lifelong childfree). Sympathetic & respectful, no bingos, me saying "I never want to bear a child and want a permanent solution" was enough to get approved for surgery. Surgery was 4 weeks from the initial request. No bingos/comments from any of the care team at Meriter Hospital at any time. Dr. Schmehil also thoughtfully offered to insert hormonal IUD specifically for period management while under the general anesthesia to avoid insertion pain/discomfort but I declined due to wanting off hormones.

[Dr. Amanda Schwartz](https://www.apmadison.com/) at Associated Physicians in Madison, WI. Dr. Schwartz performed a bilateral salpingectomy on a healthy 32 year old childless female who simply didn’t want children.

+1 Dr Neuman, Bilateral salpingectomy, age 31, unmarried, childfree (never been pregnant). I'm guessing all the doctors at this practice are CF-friendly. Dr. Neuman is young but totally competent: I've had zero issues in the year since my bisalp. She said that my knowing the exact name of the surgery proved to her that I was already well-informed and prepared. My insurance covered the entire cost except $1,500 for anesthesia. And not sure if this was on purpose, but my care team at the hospital on surgery day was all women or nonbinary people; no men.

[Dr. Julie Schurr] (https://mscwomenshealth.com/schurr/) at Physicians for Women, 2955 Triverton Pike Drive Madison, WI 53711 (608) 227-7007. Agreed to sterilize 21-year old woman at first visit, without pushback.

She was compassionate, knowledgeable, didn't bingo, and has been one of the best doctors I've ever had the pleasure meeting. She also went to bat against insurance for me. Speaking of, she did also refer me to her colleague, Dr. Eliza Bennett, for a 'second opinion' for insurance purposes. Dr. Bennett was also great, and agreed to the procedure, which I had done by Dr. Jennings. Dr. Jennings is also a specialist in endometriosis.

[Dr. Kaley Gyorfi](https://www.obgyn.wisc.edu/Directory/Profile/kbernhardtwi) and [Dr. Madeline Wetterhahn](https://www.obgyn.wisc.edu/Directory/Profile/wetterhahnwi).

**Milwaukee**

Dr. Marie M. Forgie, OBGYN. I'm 25 FTN, childfree and no health issues; I had a gender affirming total hysto which she was very happy to perform. All it took was one initial visit where we discussed my options-- she was the one to suggest a hysto since I didn't know she'd make it that easy for me. Fully explained the different types of birth control up to a radical hysto. Made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire process, never once judged or questioned my motive. She was excited alongside me. Her staff at Sinai are also very sweet.

[Dr. Dewire](https://physicians.columbia-stmarys.org/details/65459/douglas-dewire-urology-waukesha), unmarried at 25 and he gave me no guff about a vasectomy. On a lighter note his name is DE-WIRE and he does vasectomies.

**Neenah**

Valary Gass and Sara Swift, both OB/GYNs in Neenah, WI (also have clinic in Waupaca and soon [8/2022] to be in DePere) will do tubals for childfree/young/low-parity women who do not want (any/more) children. Part of the same group as Yarroch and Siomos already listed.

+1 Dr Yass, I'm 34F, never married, no kids, and neither she nor her nurse pushed back at all. Of course they have to ask the standard medical questions about previous pregnancies and deliveries, but there was no judgement and the questions felt completely clinical in nature. When I told her I was pleasantly surprised by my quick approval, she said she understands that her responsibility only goes so far as "counseling patients on risks and benefits of procedures"

Dr. Sara H Swift MD OBGYN Women's Care of Wisconsin Neenah, WI. I basically told her what procedures I wanted (Bisalp and Endometrial Ablation), and she didn't give any pushback. Our consultation talk took about 10 minutes or less, and she gave me a date for when my procedures would be. She was easy to talk too and she was a bit funny as well. I felt comfortable talking to her with whatever questions or concerns I had. She even suggested that if my Endometrial Ablation ended up failing, that our next step would be a Hysterectomy. I really recommend her!

**Oconomowoc** 

[Dr. Douglas Dewire](http://www.prohealthcare.org/doctor-dewire-douglas.aspx) - very personable, didn't give me (at 28 years old, unmarried) any trouble requesting a vasectomy with no kids. I even asked him if he would be ok with me adding him to this list and explained what it was about, and he said he was fine with it. Urology Associates ended up testing me four times afterwards over the course of ten months because it took forever to show 100% zero sperm, and didn't charge me extra for any of it. Fantastic experience.

[Allison Nelson](https://www.prohealthcare.org/find-a-provider/profile/nelson-allison/) performed a bilateral salpingectomy on an unmarried childfree 27 year old. 

**Onalaska**

[Dr. Heather Stief](https://www.gundersenhealth.org/find-a-doctor/profile/heather-stief/) was amazing and kind, did not “bingo” me, or look down on my decisions. She said she is open to sterilizing anyone who has been wanting to be sterilized, no matter their age, marital status, or if they have children. She said she will list other options and double check that they’re sure, but she has no problem doing the procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Stief to anyone in the area. Her & her team compassionate and helpful. I am a 23 y/o female, married with no kids. I had a bilateral salpingectomy. 

+1 Dr Stief, I (25F) had a bilateral salpingectomy. I'm not married (do have an SO, but wasn't asked about it at all), and have no kids. The procedure was covered by insurance. Dr. Stief is nothing but caring, helpful, and open about believing women's bodies are their own. No bingos, just going over options and when I said I wanted something permanent she was more than willing to do the procedure. Surgery went well, I'm recovered now. Highly recommend her.

**Osceola**

Dr. Michael Tiffany, DO, FACOG (OB/GYN), Osceola Medical Center, Osceola, Wisconsin (https://myomc.org/staff-portfolio/item/380-michael-tiffany-do-facog). He also works at St. Croix Health in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin (https://www.saintcroixhealth.org/our-providers/michael-tiffany-d-o-f-a-c-o-g-/). Bisalp performed on a 28F in a long-term relationship with no kids. He did make sure I was absolutely positive every step of the way but never tried changing my mind. He did ask if my partner would be willing to get a vasectomy instead, but was more than understanding when I said that was a decision for him to make about his body, and this is what I wanted for mine.

**Oshkosh** 

[Jessica Nokovic](https://care.aurorahealthcare.org/doctors/jessica-l-nokovic-oshkosh-obstetrics-gynecology-2.) Jessica performed a tubal ligation on me on 12/17/21. 
 Age: 29, Married, Childfree. I requested for a referral by my doctor so I could talk to an OBGYN about getting a tubal ligation. Dr. Nokovic was the first doctor I met in my journey to get my tubes removed. Jessica didn't bingo me at all and was very open about how children are for some people, not all people including herself. "Your body. Your choice." The procedure was partially covered by my insurance, United Healthcare. They took care of ~30% of the costs, bringing my out of pocket to be $1350.00.

-1 Dr Nokovic, I was referred to Dr Jessica Nokovic at aurora (22f) when i was 21, been on the pill since i was 12, and i have complete uterus didelphys. Expressed my concerns and why i want to be sterilized, she proceeded to force me to get a nexplanon instead. And if i was to have issues, that we would discuss further options. When i was having issues with nexplanon she told me to take my pill on top of the implant. I had to go to Planned Parenthood to get the implant removed because she woulent do it.

**Pewaukee**

[Dr. Xuan Thy Tran](http://www.mywheaton.org/find-a-doctor/profile/xuan-thy-tran/) Told her I didn't want kids and asked for an IUD; she not only didn't blink but suggested Essure instead (I declined because I'm allergic to nickel). Since not having had children makes insertion harder, and she wanted me to have the easiest time possible, she referred me to OBGYN [Dr. Amy Fox](http://www.mywheaton.org/find-a-doctor/profile/amy-fox/), who was also utterly cool with it.

He believes it’s our choice to decide how many kids we want, if any at all. He completely removes the tubes to lessen chances of ovarian cancer & of it growing back. The only waiting period would come from insurance, he has none.

**Stevens Point**

[Dr. Jenna L. Kolodziej at Aspirus Stevens Point Hospital](https://www.aspirus.org/find-a-provider/jenna-l-kolodziej-do-facoog-4104) I (26, F, unmarried) asked her about sterilization during my first visit with her. She asked a few questions during my exam to make sure I was not wavering in my decision, and then said yes and got things rolling for surgery. She performed my bilateral salpingectomy about 3 weeks after my initial appointment. The surgery was done in Wisconsin Rapids. Dr. Kolodziej was super nice, no hesitation or judgement. 10/10, you can tell she really cares about her patients and their needs.

**Wauwatosa/Milwaukee**

[Dr. Charles Kidd at Milwaukee Urology Specialists](http://milwurology.net/milwaukee-urology-specialists-practice-information/our-doctors/charles-f-kidd-md/): Did a vasectomy on a 23 year old man, unmarried and without kids. No judgment, very professional, and a very smooth surgery!

[Dr. Stephen McAvoy at Ascension Medical Group](https://healthcare.ascension.org/doctors/1689775785/stephen-p-mcavoy-wauwatosa-wi): No questions asked, approved and scheduled me for the surgery on the first consult. He typically only does tubals, but per my request, he agreed to do a bisalp. He even made my procedure "Urgent" due to current events (because of the new Supreme Court pick and because my insurance is through a faith-based hospital)

[Dr. Stacy Syrcle, OBGYN, Aurora Women's Pavillion](https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/doctors/stacy-m-syrcle-md?gclid=Cj0KCQiAsvTxBRDkARIsAH4W_j_2916FE8bCoWZcZU48l5TRzDfv6QUwRX5irjIH0lxu5ozSLlWCk_YaAjI-EALw_wcB): Only does surgery on Wednesdays. The entire practice at the Women's Pavillion cares about bodily autonomy. Dr. Syrcle prefers bisalps, but will do ligation if you'd prefer. She even took photos of the anatomy, looked at ovaries for PCOS and checked the uterus for endometriosis. She did zero bingos at 31 years old, but mentioned shes more hesitant for younger women, so be prepared.

[Dr. John Mcguiness at Aurora Medical Center](https://care.aurorahealthcare.org/doctors/john-mcguinness-west-allis-obstetrics-gynecology-2): Sterilized childfree 23W without ever questioning the decision. He only mentioned risk of regret at the first appointment and right before surgery. After affirmation, peformed bisalp without any issues.

Partial Hysterectomy (Uterus and Tubes) She stressed that it was for my "bad periods" and "side effects of BC too much" along with family history, so that insurance would cover it. No bingos, no fuss. 

**West Bend** 

[Dr. Ashley Wanless](https://www.froedtert.com/doctors/ashley-wanless-1902105216). Bilateral salpingectomy (also her preferred way) - 29F, single, no kids/childfree. I was referred by my GP and got an appointment with Dr. Wanless 2 months later. That day, she brought in consent forms before I had even talked to her. No bingos, no questions asked. We got surgery scheduled for 2 weeks later. No bingos or comments from anyone the day of. Her whole team was super nice and I had no issues with aftercare at all. I just had 3 week follow up.. everything looked good and we are both happy with the results !!

**Casper** 

[Dr. Carrie Merrill](https://casperwomenscare.com/) at Casper Women’s Care. I am 27 years old, no children, unmarried, with insurance. I came to my consultation with a binder prepared to explain my reasoning and it was immediately clear that she respected my choice and didn’t need me to explain my reasoning, and she scheduled me for surgery right away. I was extremely impressed with the professionalism.

**Cheyenne**

[Dr. Jacques Beveridge] (http://cwcob.com/cheyenne-womens-clinic-physicians-jacques-beveridge/) Essure Procedure. Can only confirm he will sterilize at least as young as 24 years old, had a brief consultation that involved a couple of questions such as to what if i changed my mind, what if a future partner wanted kids, but he didn't push and didn't require long, elaborate explanations. Procedure itself was rather quick (10-15 min tops). Wait time from call to consultation appointment: 2 weeks. Time from consultation to procedure: 2 weeks, which was due to waiting a full week after period for procedural reasons, so wait time will vary depending on your cycle.

[Dr. Stefani Bissonette](https://www.conversehospital.com/provider-directory/providers/stefani-bissonette/), +13078868193. 700 E. Center Street Douglas, Wyoming, 82633 Bilateral Salpingectomy and later, Laproscopic Hysterectomy. 23. Single/No sexual experience, ChildFree! My very first time meeting Dr Bissonette was on May 4th 2022, I told her I really wanted a tubal because I knew I did not want kids but another doctor convinced me I just needed to switch my birth control so I said I could try that first. By June 28th I had the surgery scheduled. I got an endometriosis diagnosis and by September 2022 I was back to get a complete Hysterectomy (maintaining both my ovaries) and again she did not question my choices or give the typical "you'll change your mind" or "what about your future partner." Every step of the way she has been supportive and made me feel more than comfortable. Her methods are also very advanced which made the recovery time for both surgeries extremely easy. Note* she is open to preforming hysterectomy for purposes of sterilization but will push for a tubal more for the purpose of sterilization first as it is a less invasive procedure.
