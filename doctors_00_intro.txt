*For our members using the Reddit mobile app: we recommend accessing the lists via a web browser either on desktop or mobile.* 

Disclaimer: this list is not a replacement for a consultation with a medical professional trained in gynecology/urology nor is it a diagnostic tool. As this list is dynamic and frequently being updated, we encourage our members to exercise diligence when arranging a consultation with a doctor on this list. Should you have a positive experience and wish to add your doctor to the list, we encourage advising your doctor before messaging the moderator team. More information about sterilisation can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/sterilisation).

##How to add to the Childfree Friendly Doctors list 

We are currently accepting new listings from doctors who have completed sterilisation (tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, vasectomy) for CHILDFREE people. Our definition of childfree is, "childfree refers to those who do not have and do not ever want children (whether biological, adopted, step or otherwise)". In order to add your doctor or update an existing doctor's listing, please send the moderator team a message with the following information: 

The doctor's name and a link to either a practice website or online listing. If this is not possible, then an address (in full, no abbreviations like CA or PA) and phone number is acceptable.

The procedure completed

Optional: your age, marital status, and childfree status 

Optional: a short (max 100 word) statement on your experience. Some suggestions for things to include are information on wait times, insurance, cost, or whether you experienced any bingos, for example "you'll change your mind when you hit 30" or "you'll feel differently when you find the right guy/gal". 

## FAQs 

**How do I add to the list?**

Ideally, if you have a Reddit account, send the mod team a message via this [link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchildfree&subject=&message=). One of us will send an acknowledgement reply/receipt. We recommend avoiding chat requests, PMs or comment replies, these will disappear into the void and your submission probably won’t make it into the list. If you have received no communication from us within a week please send another message. 

**I'm a gynecologist/urologist/physician/other health care professional. Can I submit myself to this list?** 

To our health care providers: thank you for your willingness to help our members! We are welcoming health care professionals who are willing to provide permanent contraception procedures (examples including tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, vasectomy) for CHILDFREE people that you deem medically and consent-wise fit for the procedure. If you would like to come on board, please message us via this [link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchildfree&subject=&message=) with the following: 

Your name and primary practice location, whether this is a private practice or consulting rooms within a hospital. Potential patients may travel from interstate to seek your services and as such as much detail in this regard as you are willing/able to provide is appreciated. 

Any insurances you accept or federal or state financial aid programs you are a part of.

If it is safe for you to advertise as such, whether you are LGBT+ friendly and/or offer gender affirming procedures.  

Any age or marital status limitations that you have. Yes, our members do get refused because "what if you get married and your husband wants a baby?". 

**Wait, do you really want recommendations from health care professionals who aren't gynecologists/urologists?** 

Yes, we do accept recommendations from other health care and allied professionals who are supportive of the childfree choice. We have therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists on our list and this is particularly important in situations where specialists demand a psychiatric evaluation before sterilising a patient. 

**Why can't I add my doctor to the list myself?** 

Until the last 12 months the list was open to edit by anyone. As a result people would:

A) add doctors because they saw on their website that they sterilise people

B) add doctors that sterilised them after they had children. For example, recently we got a very confused message from a mum of two saying that her doctor had been removed in error and please reinstate him because he sterilised her.

C) adding childfree unfriendly doctors to try and dissuade members from getting sterilised.

D) add doctors who are childfree or childless regardless of whether they were supportive or not. 

In response to this we closed the list to member edits. So if you send a message and don’t see your doctor on the list right away, that’s why. In addition, due to many people contributing to the list (which is great!) different states and countries have different formatting and different amounts of information. Right now we recommend clicking your state or country which will be towards the top of the page.

**Why isn’t my doctor on the list? I messaged months ago and no one replied.** 

There are some instances where people’s doctors don’t get added to the list. The main overarching reason for this is because the submitter hasn’t had the procedure yet. We try not to add doctors until they’ve actually done the procedure because what can happen sometimes is other doctors, the hospital, or the insurance can kick up a fuss about the procedure and effectively convince the doctor not to do it. To save distress to people who seek sterilisation from doctors on the list, we ask members to wait until they are sterilised before asking for their doctor to be added to the list. The exceptions are in cases where a general practitioner has given a referral (at that point their job is done) or in countries where there are very few/no supportive doctors, where we'll leave a note saying the doctor is yet to be verified.

The other reason is due to a submission that doesn’t have enough information to be useful to people accessing the list. It's really important to provide enough information for other people to find the doctor, especially if they're travelling from out of state and may not be familiar with local landmarks or nicknames. This could be a clinic address or phone number but the best is a link to a website or online directory listing if they’re with a hospital. Please do NOT send us your name/address/phone number, this is not necessary for your submission. We also don't need your in depth medical history or history of trauma to get your doctor on the list. 

**Your listings are outdated/inaccurate. How can I have a doctor removed from the list?** 

The best thing you can do in this case is [get in touch](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchildfree&subject=&message=)! Our policy is to put a note on their submission saying a member has had a bad experience with some details. Then if there are subsequent bad experiences they will be removed. Exceptions to this are extreme/criminal cases of malpractice. For example, a doctor was immediately removed who is being investigated for IVF related malpractice. We use this tiered approach because different people have different thresholds of “bad”. Person A might think having to see a psychologist first is just par for the course, person B might be extremely distressed by this requirement. If someone’s retired or moved it’s great if you know it to send their updated details.

**I don't want to be identified as a patient. What if I message you from a throwaway?** 

We ensure that there is no connection between your personal details/patient information and your entry on the list. Your username is not linked in any way to your submission or recommendation. We discourage messages from throwaway accounts as it is limits verifiability of your submission. If you choose to use a throwaway you will be sent follow up questions within 72 hours and your doctor will not be added unless you can answer them. Remember your throwaway password!
